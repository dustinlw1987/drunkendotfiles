07:07 -christel(christel@freenode/staff/exherbo.christel)- [Global Notice] Hi all, not only would it seem that Christmas came early this year, we must also have been much nicer than we thought! We're receiving a steady stream of packets at present and apologise for any inconvenience whilst we try work around the issue! Again, sorry and thank you for using freenode!
