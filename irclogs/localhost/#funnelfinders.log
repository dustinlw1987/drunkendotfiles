00:21 < `> if i had a choice
00:21 < `> i'd go to att
00:22 < `> than comcrap
00:22 <~J-Bird> i wanted mediacom but pops said no :(
00:22 <~J-Bird> (back when DSL came to this hicktown)
00:23 < `> mediacom
00:23 < `> is actually decent
00:23 < `> but only just
00:23 <~J-Bird> i almost had him say yes to the 20Mbs :))
00:23 < `> yeah
00:23 < `> i have 35/35 here.
00:23 < `> i actually dont need more than that
00:24 < `> and i'm the one who runs servers and crap.

00:24 < `> but i need to save money. :D
00:24 <~J-Bird> i just want to download shit faster lol

00:24 < `> with my 35/35
00:24 < `> i'm able to download a 8GB file in less than thirty minutes
00:25 <~J-Bird> plus my house is wired with old wire that fucks up my wifi connection
00:25 < `> fun.
00:25 < `> i'd pick up cheap WRT54Gs
00:25 < `> those are old, but totally capable
00:25 <~J-Bird> i had to rewire the house phone line with flatwire (CAT5) so we could get a DSL connection
00:25 < `> oh fun.
00:26 < `> i have fiber straight to this house
00:26 < `> then the ONT (optical network terminal) terminates it into MoCA and ethernet.
00:27 <~J-Bird> i just did the main phone line (kitchen and mom's room) and the other kitchen line (for interwebs)
00:27 < `> yeah
00:27 < `> did i ever show you my server rack?

00:32 < `> i'm able to do like 5.3 Mbytes/sec
00:32 <~J-Bird> AT$T for ya
00:32 < `> wolo.
00:32 < `> no
00:32 < `> that's DSL for you.
00:32 <~J-Bird> true
00:32 < `> DSL goes to shit the farther it is from the CO
00:33 <~J-Bird> yup
00:33 <~J-Bird> and plus we are the "unfortunate" that live in bumfuq egypt so we get shit wire running to us
00:33 <~J-Bird> December we had no connection for 2 weeks due to falty wire

00:42 <~J-Bird> nothing lol
00:42 <~J-Bird> but hey help me with mobile
00:42 <~J-Bird> keeps saying irc.funnelfinders.com is unreachable
00:43 < `> that'll happen
00:43 <~J-Bird> network* is unreachable
00:43 < `> because its not completely resolved across the world's networks
00:43 < `> ok, think it this way
00:43 <~J-Bird> i got it
00:44 < `> a DNS update (changing where an address goes) is like a pitcher of water
00:44 <~J-Bird> i forgot you said it will act goofy for a while
00:44 < `> and you have a big beach ball
00:44 < `> that's the Earth
00:44 <~J-Bird> reason i couldnt connect mobile (no wifi) to freenode aswell right?
00:44 < `> and then you pour it on the beach ball slowly
00:44 < `> it spreads all over the ball
00:44 < `> same thing with DNS
00:44 < `> it has to "update" throughout the world.
00:44  * ` shrugs
00:45 <~J-Bird> gotcha
00:45 < `> but i'm not entirely sure now
00:45 <~J-Bird> fuck freenode :P
00:45 < `> beause you say you couldnt connect to freenode?
00:45 <~J-Bird> but that was giving a SASL (or whatever) error
00:45 < `> oh
00:45 < `> that's because you're trying SSL
00:45 < `> or SASL
00:45 < `> disable SASL
00:45 <~J-Bird> oh well freenode is done with

01:38 < `|gabapentin> they're being fake nazis
01:38 < `|gabapentin> insulting each other
01:54 < J-Bird|Mobile> Servers don't need a display right?
01:55 < `|gabapentin> correct.
01:55 < `|gabapentin> it'll require a display for the initial setup
01:56 < `|gabapentin> then you can remotely manage it from there
01:56 < `|gabapentin> my i7, router, and dual G4 don't even have monitors attached at all
01:56 < `|gabapentin> i VNC into it instead.
01:58 < J-Bird|Mobile> Okay was Jw if I should waste money on a switch or not
01:58 < J-Bird|Mobile> Lol
01:59 < J-Bird|Mobile> Lol they just used a 4chan photo on the news >.<

18:49 < `> yeah.
18:53 < J-Bird> so what is the best server to build?
18:59 < `> out of anything.
18:59 < `> as long as it runs, it can be a server.
19:00 < `> hell
19:00 < `> i own one of those things:
19:00 < J-Bird> which OS would you prefer?
19:00 < `> debian.
19:00 < `> http://dgd.io/iAiy
19:01 < `> that is a FULL computer.
19:01 < `> it can handle XBMC at 1080p - has a HDMI output.
19:02 < `> here's another picture with all of the connections connected
19:02 < `> http://dgd.io/vGoB
19:03 < `> it runs linux perfectly, etc
19:03 < `> induring your mind completely blown
19:04 < J-Bird> someone showed this on wtfpwnt
19:04 < `> i know.
19:04 < `> but still.
19:04 < `> guess how much it costs.
19:05 < J-Bird> $15
19:05 < J-Bird> where's the PSU? lol
19:06 < `> there isnt one
19:06 < `> it's being powered by the miniUSB
19:06 < `> yes.
19:06 < `> it can be powered by just 5V USB
19:07 < `> if you look closely to the miniUSB
19:07 < `> you'll see that it's labeled "POWER"
19:08 < J-Bird> lol that's sick
19:10 < `> very.
19:10 < `> and you're wrong.

19:36 < J-Bird> dude...wall cloud :D
19:38 < J-Bird> my ISO is at 77% i hope the power don't go out lol
19:50 < `> wololo.
19:50 < `> this is the debian iso?
19:50 < `> which image is it?
19:51 < J-Bird> sorry lol
19:51 < J-Bird> my win8 release ISO
19:51 < `> ok, well
19:51 < `> let me give you the link to the latest debian with firmware-linux-nonfree
19:52 < `> 32- or 64-bit?
19:52 < `> if you use an install with firmware-linux-nonfree, it'll have all of the firmware and drivers required to init most proprietary hardware
19:53 < J-Bird> let me decide what machine to put it in first lol
19:53 < J-Bird> idk if i have another machine that works, or if i have to make it work
19:53 < `> thats the thing
19:53 < J-Bird> give me a few mins to set up a second desktop area
19:53 < `> firmware-linux-nonfree is actually capable of working on machines that the 'default' install wouldn't
19:54 < J-Bird> 'default' install?
20:01 < `> the default squeeze image that they normally tell you to download
20:02 < `> they also roll different types of images for different stuff
20:03 < `> These images are equivalent to the normal "netinst" CDs that we produce regularly, but they also include non-free firmware to make installation easier on some systems requiring proprietary but redistributable firmware. See http://wiki.debian.org/Firmware for more details.
20:03 < J-Bird> hey how come when i install an OS on this machine (HPpavillion a305w) and i reboot, it wont boot? lol
20:03 < `> define OS
20:06 < J-Bird> windows and linux
20:06 < `> oh shit
20:06 < `> that's a walmart pc
20:07 < `> (as in, sold in walmart)
20:07 < `> which means it's gotta be so shitty
20:07 < `> it's available exclusively at walmart
20:07 < `> hence the w of a305w
20:07 < `> oh god, it's ugly
20:07 < `> and celerowned.
20:08 < J-Bird> it was free
20:08 < J-Bird> :p
20:09 < J-Bird> do i need internet connect for this install?
20:09 < `> not necessarily.
20:09 < `> but would be nice.
20:09  * J-Bird looks for a spare power cord
20:09 < `> okay
20:09 < `> here's a direct link for the squeeze image
20:09 < J-Bird> i have a wireless adapter if its compatible
20:10 < `> plug it in
20:10 < `> nothing to lose.
20:10 < `> you know what, i'll give you Debian Sid
20:10 < `> most chance of it 'working'
20:10 < J-Bird> give me the link for Debian so i can DL that while i look
20:10 < `> with firmware-linux-nonfree
20:10 < J-Bird> whatever's better
20:10  * ` double checks the arch of a305w
20:11 < `> obviously 32
20:16 < J-Bird> hdd size?
20:16 < J-Bird> either got a 40GB or a 60GB lol
20:16 < J-Bird> :/ im poor
20:16 < `> 60 is more than enough.
20:17 < `> also, i have a very specific way of doing the install, so we'll need to walk through the install step-by-step
20:17 < J-Bird> okay
20:17 < `> so you'll need to port-forward port 22 to that machine.
20:17 < J-Bird> O.o
20:18 < `> trust me. :D
20:18 < `> are you using ethernet, or wifi still?
20:23 < J-Bird> right now i'm seeing if the machine will boot
20:23 < `> okay, i'm getting you the image.
20:23 < `> this image is literally only 275 MB

20:25 < J-Bird> 'Operating System not found'
20:26 < J-Bird> but i just installed ubuntu on here
20:26 < J-Bird> i have another machine but it random reboots
20:26 < `> reboot it
20:26 < `> and pull up BIOS
20:26  * J-Bird nod
20:27 < `> make sure it can see the drive.
20:27 < `> and that it's set as the primary boot drive
20:28 < J-Bird> it doesn't see it :(
20:28 < `> figures.
20:28 < `> is it attached to the system properly?
20:28 < `> sometimes the IDE cable has to be plugged in a certain way
20:28 < J-Bird> primary master - none prim slave - none secondary master - cd drive secondary slave - none
20:28 < `> otherwise, it'll be NOEP
20:29 < `> wat
20:29 < `> no drive?
20:29 < `> *hard drive
20:29 < J-Bird> nope
20:29 < `> .....
20:29 < J-Bird> let me change IDE cable
20:29 < `> thats why, then.
20:29 < `> it needs a hard drive.
20:29 < J-Bird> (only cuz i see one) lol
20:30 < J-Bird> it has a hdd in it
20:30 < `> ...
20:30 < `> take a picture
20:30 < `> or webcam, or something
20:30 < `> so i can see whats going on here
20:30 < J-Bird> wait let me try different PC
20:30 < J-Bird> (the one that random reboots)
20:30 < J-Bird> it's a better setup anyways
20:32 < J-Bird> this dl is taking 3 hrs even when other is paused
20:32 < J-Bird> let's just do it tomorrow after i get a machine to work
20:33 < J-Bird> plus i get txt after txt about the damn weather -_-

20:38 < `> tv, phone and internuts are carried over fiber.
20:39 < J-Bird> bad news...
20:39 < J-Bird> other machine/mobo doesn't support IDE HDD
20:39 < J-Bird> only SATA
20:39 < J-Bird> only SATA drive i have is in this machine
20:39 < `> hm.
20:39 < `> oh well.
20:40 < J-Bird> let me drop this drive in that machine and we will use the HELL for the server
20:40 < J-Bird> ...?
20:40 < J-Bird> i know it has atleast a couple bad ram slots tho :/
20:40 < `> so dont use those slots
20:40 < `> mark them.
20:40 < J-Bird> not sure which they are

21:23 < J-Bird> `: to do that test, do i need just to boot it up, or do they all need ram in the slots?
21:25 < `> boot 'em up with only one ram stick in one slot

21:25 < `> until it fails, then mark such slot faulty

17:45 < J-Bird|Mobile> mcp61pm-hm <- mobo with no display. Can't figure out wth is going on. It worked last time I used it.
17:50 < `> probably just died
17:50 < `> strip it.
17:50 < `> so nothing extra is in there
17:50 < `> strip it to the bare minimum that it'd run
17:50 < J-Bird|Mobile> I removed RAM and got a BIOS beep code
17:51 < J-Bird|Mobile> Could it be CPU?
17:51 < `> it's possible.
17:51 < J-Bird|Mobile> The one spare socket I DON'T have -_-
17:53 < J-Bird|Mobile> Can bad CPU cause memory failure?
17:55 < `> `no
17:56 < J-Bird|Mobile> Okay lol then fuck it. I'd rather buy a new mobo with good RAM slots than new CPU to see if that's the problem
18:22  * J-Bird|Mobile resets cmos
18:22 < J-Bird|Mobile> Let's hope this works
18:32 < J-Bird> `: fuck it lol
18:38 < J-Bird> `: would you like to assist me through this install now?
