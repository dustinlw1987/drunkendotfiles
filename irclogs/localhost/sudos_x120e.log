03:48 <Sudos|X120e> Sue is moving out and then what the hell was going on with the hosting plans?
03:49 <`> i'll just continue my shit as usual
03:49 <`> and him, well, that's the question.
03:49 <Sudos|X120e> yeah.
03:50 <Sudos|X120e> I was hoping that it'd at least be a starter towards better things.
03:50 <Sudos|X120e> but then poof, all gone
03:52 <`> yeah.
03:52 <Sudos|X120e> well, I figure this
03:53 <Sudos|X120e> it's well-endowed in memory and disk space for its age, CPUs could be better but meh, and it's not loud as fuck when on
03:53 <Sudos|X120e> it'll find a home doing something somewhere.
03:54 <`> i could really use it.
03:54 <Sudos|X120e> yeah.
03:55 <Sudos|X120e> and I figure this as well, that the shipping costs for the thing is pretty much break-even with the money that's already been put into getting it back up to speed.
03:57 <Sudos|X120e> RAM was 20, the two hard drives were 14 each, and another 12 total for shipping is 40
03:57 <Sudos|X120e> 40+20 is 60, the caddies and screws were like 8 bucks, 68 bucks.
03:59 <Sudos|X120e> I think the only other things it got were a replacement floppy drive from a donor hulk and a new SCSI cable for the CD drive.
03:59 <Sudos|X120e> and besides the CPU, were things I put in myself from spare parts.
