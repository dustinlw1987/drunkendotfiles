18:07 -!- Irssi: Starting query in localhost with Tak2
18:07 <Tak2> http://www.morpoppy.com/Mixed-Size-Dried-Poppy-Pods_c_29.html
18:07 <Tak2> those are opium poppies
18:08 <Tak2> buy them, they come in a box to your po box
18:08 <Tak2> ive never had issues
18:08 <`> expensive
18:08 <Tak2> not really
18:08 <`> mind you, i want to try it
18:08 <Tak2> cheaper than pharmas
18:08 <`> not just LOL BATCH
18:08 <`> how would one consume those?
18:08 <Tak2> listen though
18:08 <`> yeah?
18:08 <Tak2> save up some money
18:08 <Tak2> you will not regret it
18:09 <Tak2> if you get them
18:09 <Tak2> ask me how to do it
18:09 <`> how?
18:09 <Tak2> because you might od or waste them otherwise
18:09 <`> i wouldnt mind trying, and will save
18:09 <Tak2> you have to turn them to powder in a blender
18:09 <`> not a problem
18:09 <`> i have a coffee grinder here
18:09 <Tak2> then take the powder, and put it in a cheesecloth
18:10 <Tak2> (handkerchief)
18:10 <`> (that i use for bud)
18:10 <`> yeah
18:10 <Tak2> and seep that in very ot but not boiling water
18:10 <Tak2> for about 5-10 minutes
18:10 <Tak2> then pull the cloth out, the water will be very dark and bitter
18:10 <Tak2> but all the plant matter will be filtered by the cloth, just like a tea bag
18:11 <`> right right.
18:11 <Tak2> i would not suggest you try more than 2 the first time
18:11 <Tak2> because you might od
18:11 <Tak2> its raw opium
18:12 <`> okay, i'll try that out
18:12 <`> thanks!
18:12 <Tak2> one box of those will last you a month or more
18:12 <Tak2> even if you are an addict
18:12 <Tak2> its dirt cheap
18:12 <Tak2> you just have to be willing to commit up front
18:12 <Tak2> which sucks
18:12 <Tak2> because by the time you are done with a box
18:12 <Tak2> even if it takes you 3 months
18:13 <Tak2> you will be an addict
18:13 <`> lol
18:13 <`> which one of the $75 ones is better?
18:14 <Tak2> doesnt matter
18:14 <Tak2> buy it by weight
18:14 <`> yeah, 1/2 pound
18:14 <Tak2> if you want less hassle buy the bigger pods
18:15 <Tak2> if you want more value, buy mixed
18:15 <Tak2> but im not kidding you dude
18:15 <Tak2> and i say this with all seriousness
18:15 <Tak2> opiate addiction is no joke
18:15 <Tak2> its not going to be a "it wont happen to me, i can control it" thing
18:15 <`> i more than likely will just try some of it and then sell the rest
18:15 <Tak2> its going to kick your ass
18:16 <Tak2> no you wont
18:16 <Tak2> you will try it once
18:16 <Tak2> and you will fall in love
18:16 <Tak2> and you wont give it up for the world
18:16 <Tak2> its the perfect drug
18:16 <`> lols
18:16 <Tak2> im not kidding
18:17 <`> whats the feeling like?
18:17 <Tak2> well
18:17 <Tak2> hard to explain
18:17 <Tak2> i dont know what your childhood was like
18:18 <Tak2> but imagine being a 7 year old, dressed in warm pajamas, with everyone who loves you all around you, next to a warm fire, on xmas morning, with 20 presents to unwrap
18:18 <`> completely independent.
18:18 <Tak2> nothing can touch you
18:18 <`> lol
18:18 <`> damn
18:18 <Tak2> you are invulnerable
18:19 <Tak2> someone starts talking shit? you will shut them down without even trying
18:19 <`> how so?
18:19 <Tak2> it separates you from any emotional response
18:19 <Tak2> nothing they say will effect you at all
18:20 <Tak2> and you can disect it and turn it back around on them ina  heartbeat
18:20 <Tak2> its like a godmode cheat to life
18:20 <Tak2> but tolerance eventually kicks in
18:21 <Tak2> and you have to have it
18:21 <Tak2> or else you get insanely sick
18:21 <`> at what point would it make one sick?
18:21 <Tak2> and even after the sickness is gone (about 2 weeks)
18:22 <Tak2> if you did it every day for a week, then stopped cold turkey, you would feel the very mild beginnings of it
18:22 <Tak2> you would have trouble sleeping, restless limbs, etc
18:22 <`> i already have all that
18:22 <Tak2> but if you did it every day for 3 months, then quit
18:22 <`> restless limbs and shit
18:23 <Tak2> you would be in big fucking trouble
18:23 <Tak2> it sounds minor
18:23 <`> yeah
18:23 <Tak2> but its living hell
18:23 <`> cant sleep.
18:23 <`> yeah.
18:23 <Tak2> hehe
18:23 <Tak2> k
18:23 <Tak2> just go for it then
18:23 <Tak2> :>
18:23 <`> i like to think i'm smart enough to handle it
18:23 <Tak2> but when you come in here crying
18:23 <`> lol yep.
18:24 <Tak2> dont say i didnt warn you
18:24 <Tak2> im pretty fucking smart too
18:24 <Tak2> never had a problem with any other drug
18:24 <Tak2> and i kept up with my opiate addiction for over 3 years
18:24 <Tak2> and kept my job, house, car, etc
18:25 <`> yeah
18:25 <`> i have almost nothing
18:25 <Tak2> but 99.5% of people dont
18:25 <`> let alone afford food
18:25 <`> so i dunno
18:25 <Tak2> a full blown withdrawl is like
18:25 <Tak2> imagine hell
18:25 <Tak2> seriously
18:25 <Tak2> try to imagine it
18:25 <Tak2> what it might feel like
18:25 <Tak2> divine punishment
18:26 <`> yeah
18:26 <Tak2> thats the only word i can really use to explain it
18:26 <`> divine punishment for using godmode cheats.
18:26 <`> how old are you btw?
18:27 <Tak2> stomach virus+flu+migrane+irritable+insomnia+hyperhydrosis+whatever else
18:27 <Tak2> im 31
18:28 <`|gabapentin|420> so you've been 'there'
18:29 <Tak2> ive lived a pretty tortured life
18:29 <`|gabapentin|420> how so?
18:29 <Tak2> long story, dont really want to go there
18:30 <`|gabapentin|420> np np
18:30 <Tak2> im "with it" enough to function, and be pretty sane
18:31 <Tak2> im not missing any cans to my six pack so to speak
18:31 <Tak2> im just missing the plastic thingy that holds them all together
18:32 <Tak2> ive done enough drugs for 20-30 people
18:32 <Tak2> im suprised i maintain to be honest
18:32 <`|gabapentin|420> probably your upbringing.
18:32 <Tak2> even more suprised to excel
18:33 <Tak2> well i come from wealth, that is true
18:33 <Tak2> ive always had daddies lawyers to get me out of whatever trouble i get in
18:33 <Tak2> and they paid for my education
18:33 <Tak2> but after that, i was able to fly on my own
18:34 <`|gabapentin|420> yeah
18:34 <`|gabapentin|420> it seems like you have to have wealth supporting you to get a good bearing in society
18:34 <Tak2> its a double edged sword in my case though
18:35 <Tak2> because my dad is a doctor
18:35 <`|gabapentin|420> lol so thats how you get your shit?
18:35 <Tak2> his buddies give me more drugs than they should
18:35 <Tak2> :>
18:35 <`|gabapentin|420> rofl
18:36 <Tak2> i need to go get more booze
18:36 <Tak2> ill bbiab
