03:26 <bikcmp> uh
03:26 <`|gabapentin> so i can give you places closest to you?
03:26 <bikcmp> why
03:27 <bikcmp> voorhees is about 8 miles long
03:27 <bikcmp> er
03:27 <bikcmp> big
03:27 <`|gabapentin> well
03:27 <bikcmp> i'm near the cvs on kresson road
03:27 <bikcmp> route 73
03:27 <`|gabapentin> assuming google's saying voorhees is center
03:27 <bikcmp> oh
03:27 <`|gabapentin> center of the town
03:27 <bikcmp> eschalon
03:27 <bikcmp> bah
03:27 <bikcmp> can't spell it
03:27 <`|gabapentin> so
03:27 <bikcmp> voorhees town center
03:27 <bikcmp> right?
03:27 <bikcmp> next to the macys
03:27 <`|gabapentin> google claims penn school for the deaf
03:27 <`|gabapentin> is 19 miles NW
03:28 <bikcmp> so, add on 5 miles away from town center
03:28 <bikcmp> 24 miles away
03:28 <`|gabapentin> not that bad
03:28 <bikcmp> about 30ish mins of a drive
03:28 <bikcmp> one problem:
03:28 <bikcmp> dad can't drive
03:28 <bikcmp> mom won't drive
03:28 <bikcmp> :)
03:28 <`|gabapentin> public transportation.
03:28 <bikcmp> they get all concerned
03:28 <bikcmp> :P
03:28 <bikcmp> sure, we won't drive you, but if someone else does...
03:28 <bikcmp> :-P
03:28 <`|gabapentin> i dont get it?
03:28 <bikcmp> tell me about it
03:28 <bikcmp> overprotective not caring parents
03:28 <bikcmp> lol
03:29 <`|gabapentin> they're pennypinchers
03:29 <`|gabapentin> dont want to spend gas money
03:29 <bikcmp> yeah 
03:29 <bikcmp> well
03:29 <bikcmp> and living in the richest part of town
03:29 <bikcmp> yeah
03:29 <bikcmp> it's stupid.
03:29 <`|gabapentin> just gimme your street?
03:29 <`|gabapentin> so i can finetune
03:29 <bikcmp> kresson road
03:29 <`|gabapentin> kk
03:29 <bikcmp> it isn't my street
03:29 <bikcmp> but like
03:29 <bikcmp> it's about a 2 minute walk
03:29 <bikcmp> lol
03:30 <`|gabapentin> yeah, got it
03:30 <`|gabapentin> okay
03:30 <`|gabapentin> yuk
03:30 <bikcmp> see?
03:30 <bikcmp> i'm sol
03:30 <`|gabapentin> it's 1h50m trip
03:30 <bikcmp> seriously
03:30 <`|gabapentin> you're 16?
03:30 <bikcmp> yes
03:30 <`|gabapentin> damn.
03:31 <bikcmp> no, can't drive until i'm 18
03:31 <bikcmp> :P
03:31 <bikcmp> that's why i'm always open to signing with you or others
03:31 <`|gabapentin> yeah.
03:31 <bikcmp> well
03:31 <bikcmp> here's the thing
03:31 <bikcmp> the voorhees school district is very good to disabled children.
03:31 <bikcmp> a lot of people move here because they have a disabled kid.
03:31 <`|gabapentin> hm.
03:31 <bikcmp> i'm luckily not disabled, but yeah
03:31 <bikcmp> basically
03:32 <`|gabapentin> there's interpreting service nearby
03:32 <bikcmp> i'm hoping that next school year (2 months...), i'll be able to find a kid with speech disabilities
03:32 <`|gabapentin> maybe you can go there and glean some info
03:32 <bikcmp> speech or hearing
03:32 <`|gabapentin> see if there's something like DNOs
03:32 <bikcmp> dno's?
03:32 <`|gabapentin> Deaf Night OUt
03:32 <bikcmp> oh
03:32 <bikcmp> who would drive
03:32 <bikcmp> :-P
03:32 <`|gabapentin> usually happens once a month
03:32 <`|gabapentin> but you basically need to gtfo
03:32 <`|gabapentin> and find info
03:32 <bikcmp> i know right
03:33 <bikcmp> dude
03:33 <bikcmp> i've tried
03:33 <bikcmp> i've called
03:33 <bikcmp> everything
03:33 <bikcmp> VCO is very useful to me
03:33 <`|gabapentin> nada?
03:33 <bikcmp> know if convowhatever has it?
03:33 <bikcmp> so i could at the least learn from VCO
03:33 <`|gabapentin> well
03:33 <`|gabapentin> i think it does VCO
03:34 <`|gabapentin> hold on
03:34 <bikcmp> but you need to tell the operator
03:34 <`|gabapentin> i'll call back
03:34 <bikcmp> in which i don't know how to do
03:34 <bikcmp> lol
03:34 <bikcmp> when you call back i want to pretend to be some user
03:34 <bikcmp> like, pretend to want vco or something
03:34 <bikcmp> i'd like to at the least get down the stuff that they'd most likely say
03:34 <bikcmp> lol
03:34 <bikcmp> say stuff like 'hold', 'hung up'
03:35 <`|gabapentin> okay
03:35 <`|gabapentin> i just spoke with an operator
03:35 <`|gabapentin> they say that they have two ways of doing VCO
03:35 <`|gabapentin> they can accept mic input directly from the convo app
03:36 <bikcmp> or call me back
03:36 <`|gabapentin> and then carry that over (VCO)
03:36 <bikcmp> yeah
03:36 <`|gabapentin> or use an separate phone line
03:36 <`|gabapentin> and use that to carry voic
03:36 <`|gabapentin> e
03:36 <bikcmp> seperate phone line?
03:36 <`|gabapentin> thats the "old" way
03:36 <`|gabapentin> no need to do that, really, last resort
03:37 <bikcmp> well
03:37 <bikcmp> here's the thing
03:37 <bikcmp> i can't tell the operator 
03:37 <bikcmp> i don't know how to sign it.
03:37 <bikcmp> here, i'll call you
03:37 <bikcmp> and pretend to want vco
03:37 <bikcmp> ok
03:37 <`|gabapentin> you need to center your hand
03:37 <`|gabapentin> in the camera
03:38 <bikcmp> oh
03:38 <`|gabapentin> so the interp can see it clearly
03:38 <bikcmp> sign that again slowly
03:38 <bikcmp> this way or that way
03:39 <`|gabapentin> always sideway
03:39 <bikcmp> for o?
03:39 <bikcmp> and c?
03:39 <`|gabapentin> yes
03:39 <`|gabapentin> for the camera, anyway
03:39 <`|gabapentin> irl doesnt matter
03:39 <`|gabapentin> but
03:39 <`|gabapentin> dont separate your fingers for the C
03:39 <bikcmp> yeah
03:39 <`|gabapentin> make sure it's togheter
03:39 <`|gabapentin> like
03:39 <`|gabapentin> you're actually cupping a cup
03:39 <bikcmp> i also try to talk while i sign
03:39 <bikcmp> don't know whether you noticed
03:40 <`|gabapentin> you're still KINDA fudging the C
03:40 <`|gabapentin> but we'll work ont hat
03:40 <`|gabapentin> it takes practice :D
03:40 <`|gabapentin> :D
03:40 <`|gabapentin> it's all good, dont worry
03:41 <`|gabapentin> 16
03:41 <`|gabapentin> basically shaking the 6-9 letters to make a double digit
03:41 <bikcmp> how do you sign '20'

03:44 <bikcmp> hm
03:44 <bikcmp> have you noticed any blood in the trashcans?
03:44 <bikcmp> they can either signal one of two things
03:44 <`|gabapentin> fortunately, no
03:44 <bikcmp> he's a heroin addict
03:44 <bikcmp> or
03:44 <bikcmp> he's a woman

20:59 <`> [7/18/12 6:44:17 PM] Dustin: his words: "i'm a manbaby."
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:44:34 PM] Dustin: he hasn't shown any effort
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:44:56 PM] Dustin: i told him i'll help whenever i can
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:45:00 PM] Dustin: i see nothing.
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:45:34 PM] Dustin: whatever.
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:46:27 PM] Emily: mmmm
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:46:32 PM] Emily: he's going back
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:46:36 PM] Emily: because of the asl thing?
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:47:21 PM] Dustin: [7/18/12 6:31:19 PM] Zachary Hardesty: i'm sorry i'm running
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:31:30 PM] Zachary Hardesty: i just don't see myself getting anywhere without a car
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:31:36 PM] Zachary Hardesty: anywhere in life
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:47:41 PM] Emily: well how do you get a car?
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:47:45 PM] Dustin: exactly
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:47:59 PM] Dustin: i told him theres jobs to be had, that he can save up for a car.
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:48:07 PM] Dustin: he's still pissmoaning.
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:48:35 PM] Emily: lol
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:48:42 PM] Dustin: so i dont know.
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:48:57 PM] Dustin: fuck, i need a bowl
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:48:59 PM] Dustin: and i have nothign.

21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:49:20 PM] Dustin: how is it?
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:49:32 PM] Emily: haven't
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:49:47 PM] Emily: i was offering, if you guys needed a break from each other
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:50:22 PM] Dustin: its not even that
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:50:25 PM] Dustin: we barely even talk
21:00 <`> [7/18/12 6:50:31 PM] Dustin: he
21:01 <bikcmp> mind if i ask who emily is?
21:01 <`> one of my *good* deaf friends
21:01 <bikcmp> ah
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:50:37 PM] Emily: oooh i got it now
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:50:41 PM] Dustin: he's doing nothing, basically
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:51:15 PM] Emily: to learn asl?
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:51:18 PM] Emily: or in general
21:01 <bikcmp> well
21:01 <bikcmp> between you and me
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:51:21 PM] Dustin: not just that.
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:51:26 PM] Dustin: yeah, in general.
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:51:37 PM] Dustin: theres this one user in one of the chat networks i hang on
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:51:45 PM] Dustin: he works with Zach
21:01 <bikcmp> it sounds like zach is fucking lazy
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:52:10 PM] Dustin: he knows WAY more sign than Zach does; and he has NEVER seen anybody sign until last night when we skyped.
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:52:47 PM] Dustin: i helped him fix some of the signs he learned online, but frankly, i was amazed at his progress - especially without deaf interaction
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:53:01 PM] Dustin: he's using VRS to learn, which is pretty clever
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:53:08 PM] Dustin: he calls VRS and leaves himself messages
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:53:20 PM] Dustin: and then watches the RO sign and learn from that
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:53:22 PM] Dustin: clever.
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:53:41 PM] Emily: i like when people show THAT much effort
21:01 <`> [7/18/12 6:53:46 PM] Dustin: yes! that
21:01 <bikcmp> :-)
21:02 <bikcmp> i'm glad to, uh, hear that
21:02 <`> ;)
21:02 <`> but it illustrates what's up with Sue.
21:02 <bikcmp> it's pretty sad when someone who's never signed with a deaf person in real life can sign better than someone living with you
21:02 <bikcmp> sue knows this?
21:02 <bikcmp> actually know what
21:02 <`> no
21:02 <bikcmp> why are we typing this
21:02 <`> heh
21:02 <bikcmp> let me restart into windows.
21:02 <bikcmp> this time i'm wearing somehting more than just an undershirt
21:02 <bikcmp> lol
21:02 <`> heh
21:06 <bikcmp> k
21:06 <bikcmp> in windows
21:06 <bikcmp> but like
21:06 <bikcmp> so what happened
21:06 <bikcmp> sue just ran away?
21:07 <`> he's still here, but in effect, yes
21:07 <bikcmp> so like
21:07 <bikcmp> what will happen
21:07 <`> he just told me that hes planning to go back up next week
21:07 <`> i have no fucking clue.
21:07 <bikcmp> he sounds like he has problems.
21:07 <`> i'm seriously disappointed.
21:07 <bikcmp> that's really weird.
21:07 <bikcmp> he's just too lazy to sign with you?
21:07 <`> i guess?
21:08 <bikcmp> also
21:08 <bikcmp> i know i keep forgetting this
21:08 <bikcmp> last time, i swear
21:08 <bikcmp> what was that sign that i did last night- the one where you put the thumb up to the chin
21:08 <bikcmp> and the index finger moves.
21:08 <bikcmp> it was when, who, or something
21:08 <`> i'd need to see it
21:08 <`> but that sounds like `who'
21:09 <bikcmp> how would you sign who?
21:09 <`> i'm on convo
21:09 <bikcmp> ah
21:09 <bikcmp> i know there's one that you go around your lips
21:09 <bikcmp> i'm looking it up in an asl dictionary
21:09 <bikcmp> i'm trying to learn 10 new words a day.
21:10 <`> thats awesome
21:10 <bikcmp> the difference with me and sue is the fact that i really want to try to learn
21:10 <bikcmp> he's more of a "i want to just crash here"
21:10 <bikcmp> i'm trying to do as much sign as i fucking can
21:10 <bikcmp> sue doesn't feel stupid that someone who's never spoken to a deaf man before knows more than him?
21:10 <`> :D
21:11 <`> yeah i dunno
21:11 <bikcmp> he sounds like a lazy asshat
21:11 <`> its starting to look like it, too.
21:11 <`> he just plays games most of the day.
21:11 <`> i dont claim to be any better
21:11 <`> but still.
21:11  * bikcmp shrugs
21:12 <`> i at least try to accomplish some things
21:12 <bikcmp> here, so i try to get practice in
21:12 <bikcmp> explain it to me on convorelay or something
21:12 <bikcmp> second
21:12 <`> i even asked him to give me a copy of his psp gameboy emulator
21:12 <`> i still haven't seen anything.
21:12 <bikcmp> i could give you one
21:12 <`> i hate to rag on him
21:12 <`> but grr.
21:12 <bikcmp> i played it all the time in my engineering classes
21:12 <bikcmp> lol
21:12 <`> i know he can do better
21:12 <`> fuck.
21:12 <bikcmp> ?
21:12 <`> i'm officially an adult bitching about a kid's laziness.
21:13 <`> ._.
21:13 <`> i'm getting old D:
21:13 <bikcmp> news
21:14 <bikcmp> sue isn't around you
21:14 <bikcmp> right?
21:14 <`> no.
21:14 <`> we have our own rooms, but interconnected
21:14 <`> if i open my door, i can see him at his desk
21:15 <bikcmp> ah

21:20  * ` burns a bowl in a bubbler.
21:21 <bikcmp> how the heck do you do that
21:21 <`> wasn't sure if you were ... comfortable watching me doing that
21:21 <bikcmp> bubbler, hm
21:21 <bikcmp> what is a bubbler
21:21 <`> fuck it
21:21 <`> i'll just show you

21:24 <`> it's pretty interesting.
21:24 <bikcmp> yeah
21:24 <bikcmp> well
21:24 <bikcmp> i don't want to have browsing history like that
21:24 <bikcmp> haha
21:25 <bikcmp> nj weed laws aren't as, uh
21:25 <bikcmp> forgiving
21:25 <`> no kidding
21:25 <`> this is my weed license
21:25 <bikcmp> frankly if cigs are legal
21:25 <`> lol
21:25 <bikcmp> i think weed should be
21:26 <bikcmp> carry with you at all times
21:26 <`> i agree
21:26 <bikcmp> ll
21:26 <`> yeah
21:26 <`> i have a original doctor's recommendation
21:26 <bikcmp> smoke weed in front of the president
21:26 <bikcmp> lol
21:26 <bikcmp> what do you do to get that
21:26 <`> go to a MMA Clinic
21:26 <`> (medial marj)
21:26 <bikcmp> "I NEED WEED, MY ASS HURTS"
21:26 <`> actually

21:27 <bikcmp> my dad is paralized
21:27 <bikcmp> no weed for him though
21:27 <bikcmp> :(
21:27 <`> bummar.
21:27 <`> if he had weed
21:27 <bikcmp> yeah :(
21:27 <`> he'd probably settle down
21:27 <`> lol
21:27 <bikcmp> lol
21:27 <bikcmp> he's on some fucking heavvvvvvvvvvvvy meds
21:27 <`> not be all FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
21:27 <bikcmp> no, he's on meds that make him out of it
21:27 <`> ah.
21:27 <`> that bad, eh?
21:27 <bikcmp> very very bad
21:27 <bikcmp> but yeah
21:27 <bikcmp> :(
21:28 <`> bumamr.
21:28 <`> *bummar.
21:28 <`> k, takign hit
21:29 <`> trying to hold it in as long as i can
21:29 <`> since that was the only bowl i had
21:29 <`> just turned ac back on
21:29 <`> since it messes with the flame
21:30 <`> do you sit indian-style on your chair sometimes?
21:30 <bikcmp> indian style?
21:30 <bikcmp> cross leged?
21:30  * ` shrugs
21:30 <`> yeah.
21:30 <bikcmp> nope
21:30 <bikcmp> never
21:30 <`> i do it all the time
21:30 <`> im weird like that
21:30 <`> lol
21:30 <bikcmp> my legs always fall numb
21:30 <bikcmp> so yeah
21:30 <`> i alternate
21:31 <`> i X sue
21:31 <bikcmp> tell me about sue
21:31 <`> the 'about' sign threw me off
21:31 <`> it's supposed to be:
21:31 <bikcmp> how should i sign about
21:31 <`> one loop and then touch finger
21:32 <`> i missed that
21:32 <`> :P
21:32 <`> but basically, every time i go to the kitchen, i have to go thru his room
21:32 <`> he does try
21:33 <bikcmp> 'sue too lazy to sign with you'
21:33 <`> but he doesn't .... keep up the effort
21:33 <`> yeah
21:33 <`> i got that
21:33 <bikcmp> ok
21:33 <bikcmp> uh
21:33 <`> that sign kinda means "whoa"
21:33 <bikcmp> "sue hangs out in that room?"
21:33 <`> close
21:33 <`> i was modifying your sentence
21:33 <`> to modern ASL :P
21:34 <`> "sue is whoa lazy"
21:34 <`> tap L to top shoulder
21:34 <`> that's whoa
21:34 <`> yeah.
21:35 <bikcmp> 'sue too lazy to sign with you', version 2:
21:35 <`> with ASL
21:35 <`> dont sign "to" so much
21:35 <`> it's implied
21:35 <`> alrady
21:35 <`> *already
21:35 <bikcmp> i'm pretty much doing signed english
21:35 <bikcmp> i don't know asl syntx
21:35 <`> right
21:35 <bikcmp> ax
21:35 <`> i'm helping you with that now ;)
21:35 <bikcmp> yeah
21:35 <`> seriously
21:35 <`> if you have money
21:35 <`> or can get money
21:35 <bikcmp> asl syntax is weird
21:36 <`> get this book.
21:36 <bikcmp> is it online?
21:36 <`> i'm not sure if someone ripped the book
21:36 <`> but
21:36 <bikcmp> or google book
21:36 <bikcmp> who owns books anymore
21:36 <bikcmp> :)
21:37 <`> http://dgd.io/hXLP
21:37 <bikcmp> 'out of stock.'
21:38 <`> not from other sellers
21:38 <`> and apparently
21:38 <`> tpb has lessons 20-22
21:38 <`> of the second edition of that book
21:38 <bikcmp> argh
21:38 <bikcmp> i want entire thing
21:38 <`> i know
21:38 <`> D:
21:39 <`> might as well grab it and keep it just in case
21:39 <`> http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4931851/A_Basic_Course_in_ASL__Lessons_20-22
21:39 <bikcmp> you forgot
21:39 <bikcmp> comcast blocks torrents.
21:39 <bikcmp> :-)
21:40 <`> another reason i will never use communistcrap
21:40 <bikcmp> ikr
21:40 <`> and wasn't that fucking declared illegal
21:40 <bikcmp> yep
21:40 <bikcmp> "and?"
21:40 <bikcmp> fuck comcast
21:40 <`> so they're violating the law.
21:40 <bikcmp> they say they don't
21:40 <bikcmp> but like
21:40 <bikcmp> the torrents just are SO SLOW
21:40 <`> they perform DPI
21:40 <bikcmp> and sometimes fail
21:40 <`> yeah
21:40 <`> DPI
21:40 <bikcmp> they HAVE to be doing something.
21:40 <`> Deep Packet Inspection
21:40 <`> and QoS
21:41 <bikcmp> ikr
21:41 <`> QoS isn't illegal
21:41 <bikcmp> qos isn't
21:41 <bikcmp> DPI is
21:41 <`> which is bullshit
21:41 <bikcmp> eh
21:41 <bikcmp> why wouldn't you want dpi
21:41 <bikcmp> err
21:41 <bikcmp> qos
21:41 <`> DPI isn't illegal if not collecting the data
21:41 <`> they just use DPI for their QoS systems
21:41 <`> from what i understand
21:41 <bikcmp> hm
21:42 <`> so people can't go encapsulating packets with something else
21:42 <`> etc
21:42 <`> like i said
21:42 <`> they're very fucking communist
21:42 <bikcmp> yeah
21:43 <bikcmp> i'm looking at two versions.
21:43 <`> like you're including "everything" around you
21:43 <bikcmp> i like the latter better.
21:43 <bikcmp> you signed the first.
21:44 <`> it really depends on context
21:44 <bikcmp> that was the one i'm looking at
21:44 <bikcmp> a then 'l
21:44 <`> those two versions have distinct use
21:44 <`> like
21:44 <`> if you're saying about
21:44 <`> the country
21:44 <`> no fuck that analogy
21:44 <bikcmp> i was about to say
21:44 <`> ALL THE THINGS!
21:45 <bikcmp> 'all of the country'
21:45 <`> you use the fingerspelled sign
21:45 <`> but if you're talking about like
21:45 <`> all tof the food in the shopping cart
21:45 <`> you'd say
21:45 <bikcmp> like
21:45 <bikcmp> i'm signing 'all', 'gone'
21:45 <`> all gone.
21:45 <`> that's for people
21:46 <`> as in, they "all left"
21:46 <`> that means "all out.
21:46 <`> of whatever"
21:46 <bikcmp> the store was all out
21:46 <`> right
21:46 <`> so you see there's distinct signs
21:46 <`> for specific contextes
21:46 <bikcmp> i don't get when you'd use sign #1 and #2
21:46 <`> *contexts
21:46 <bikcmp> like, you know?
21:46 <bikcmp> all is all.
21:47 <`> yeah hm.
21:47 <`> honestly
21:47 <bikcmp> it doesn't matter tbh
21:47 <`> i fyou get that book
21:47 <bikcmp> like
21:47 <bikcmp> you know
21:47 <bikcmp> i can understand people
21:47 <bikcmp> and they can understand me
21:47 <bikcmp> big deal
21:47 <`> it'd be a huge difference since it also explains the SYNTAX of asl
21:47 <bikcmp> hm
21:47 <bikcmp> well
21:47 <`> it doesn't just teach you about the signs, but about the grammar and syntax of ASL
21:47 <bikcmp> one
21:47 <bikcmp> it doesn't seem like that book will ship soon
21:47 <`> dude
21:47 <bikcmp> "we don't know when thi item will be back in stock"
21:47 <`> never take amazon at face value
21:47 <`> click used
21:48 <bikcmp> oh
21:48 <`> 18 new; 99 used
21:48 <`> ;)
21:48 <bikcmp> lol used book
21:48 <`> so just click 18 new
21:48 <`> if you want new.
21:48 <bikcmp> yeah
21:48 <bikcmp> obv i want used
21:48 <bikcmp> or cheapest
21:48 <bikcmp> does it also tech you signs?
21:48 <bikcmp> teach
21:49 <`> yes
21:49 <bikcmp> might get it then
21:49 <`> i have friends who took classes with that book
21:49 <bikcmp> really wish there was a google book
21:49 <`> came back being able to completely hold a conversation with me
21:49 <`> without difficulty
21:49 <bikcmp> i have a 100 dollar amazon credit
21:49 <bikcmp> so
21:49 <bikcmp> yeah
21:49 <`> DO IT
21:49 <`> damn it, do it
21:49 <`> i've recommended that book to other people
21:50 <`> but nooooooo
21:50 <`> they wussed out on buying it
21:50 <bikcmp> let me see if i can find an online copy
21:50 <bikcmp> yes, even for a fee
21:50  * bikcmp mumblemumble
21:51 <`> jesus
21:51 <`> get the hardcopy
21:51 <`> it's MUCH easier to deal with/learn from
21:51 <`> but ok
21:51 <bikcmp> old book
21:51 <bikcmp> 1993?
21:51 <bikcmp> lol
21:51 <`> ....trust me
21:51 <`> it's a foundational book
21:51 <bikcmp> i'm sure i thasn't changed much
21:52 <bikcmp> No eBook available.
21:52 <bikcmp> :(
21:52 <`> as in, it sets up a VERY solid foundation
21:52 <bikcmp> god this fucking sucks
21:52 <bikcmp> ok amazon, what do you want from m
21:52 <bikcmp> e
21:52 <bikcmp> :(
21:52 <bikcmp> why are all these sign books so old
21:52 <bikcmp> 1983
21:52 <bikcmp> lol
21:53 <`> 1st gen is 1983
21:53 <`> 2nd ed is '94
21:54 <`> it's a good investment
21:54 <`> i bought a copy
21:54 <`> but a friend never returned it
21:54 <`> sigh.
21:54 <bikcmp> i'm sur eyou don't need it
21:54 <`> i do.
21:58 <bikcmp> hm
21:58 <bikcmp> did my phone die
21:58 <bikcmp> lol
22:00 <`> fucking battery.
22:02 <bikcmp> :(
22:02 <bikcmp> dude
22:02 <bikcmp> i hate that 911 button
22:02 <bikcmp> i almost just clicked it
22:02 <`> lolol
22:03 <`> i actually clicked it
22:03 <`> on purpose
22:03 <bikcmp> then i wouldn't be able to say "no emergency"
22:03 <`> and said
22:03 <bikcmp> yeah?
22:03 <`> "oops, i accidentally clicked it"
22:03 <`> "oh, no problem"
22:03 <`> because ultimately it reaches the RO first
22:03 <bikcmp> i'm sure 99/100 calls they get are accidents
22:03 <bikcmp> lol
22:03 <bikcmp> don't they need to dispatch someone just in case?
22:03 <bikcmp> that's hard wired 911
22:03 <`> not necessarily
22:04 <bikcmp> i know my dad accidently dialed 911 from our landline
22:04 <bikcmp> don't ask me how
22:04 <`> they send first responders to the address on file
22:04 <bikcmp> lol
22:04 <bikcmp> yeah
22:04 <`> but
22:04 <bikcmp> unless you tell them otherwise
22:04 <`> fuck it
22:04 <`> i'm gonna test it
22:04 <bikcmp> lol
22:04 <bikcmp> wait
22:04 <`> see if anything's new
22:04 <bikcmp> wait a second
22:04 <bikcmp> can you record the entire convo?
22:04 <bikcmp> like, you and the person?
22:04 <bikcmp> i want to see how a vrs call normally goes.
22:04 <bikcmp> arg. did you get that in time?
22:05 <`> ?
22:05 <bikcmp> record it
22:05 <bikcmp> like, record what you sign
22:05 <bikcmp> and what the ro signed
22:05 <bikcmp> i want to see how a typical call goes
22:06 <`> okay
22:06 <bikcmp> are you able to do that, or no
22:06 <bikcmp> lol
22:06 <`> dubbing video track
22:06 <bikcmp> as long as i see both idc
22:06 <bikcmp> lol
22:06 <`> but
22:06 <`> this is basically me starting the 911 call and cancelling
22:07 <bikcmp> well
22:07 <bikcmp> i'd like to ee that too
22:07 <bikcmp> but maybe afterwards call my cell phone or something
22:09 <`> fuck you vlc
22:09 <`> every now and then
22:09 <bikcmp> didn't record? :(
22:09 <`> it fucking ties up the entire program "rebuilding font cache"
22:09 <`> fuck you.
22:09 <bikcmp> ?
22:09 <`> nothing
22:09 <`> i hate things cockblocking me
22:09 <bikcmp> you didn't get it? :(
22:09 <`> when i like to do things quickly
22:09 <`> i didnt do a vrs call
22:09 <bikcmp> oh
22:09 <bikcmp> what did you do
22:10 <`> but lol shows what happened with 911 test
22:10 <bikcmp> lol?
22:10 <bikcmp> i'm confused as hell
22:10 <`> i'll record the vrs call, though
22:10 <bikcmp> do it
22:10 <bikcmp> if you can, both sides
22:10 <`> http://dgd.io/mV3S
22:12 <bikcmp> k
22:12 <bikcmp> downloading
22:13 <bikcmp> you didn't even sign with the person
22:13 <bikcmp> wasn't what i expected
22:13 <bikcmp> lol
22:13 <`> yeah
22:14 <`> but it illustrated what i was trying to say
22:14 <`> it hits the RO first
22:14 <bikcmp> oh i know that
22:14 <bikcmp> then the ro forwards it
22:14 <bikcmp> yeah
22:14 <bikcmp> i know
22:14 <`> yeah.
22:14 <bikcmp> try calling my cell phone or something and record it
22:14 <bikcmp> leave a voicemail
22:14 <`> heh
22:14 <bikcmp> i'd like to see how someting like that goes
22:14 <bikcmp> something*
22:15 <bikcmp> 856 448 4221
22:15 <bikcmp> it'll go right to voicemail
22:15 <bikcmp> record it
22:16 <bikcmp> doing it?
22:19 <`> no
22:19 <`> speaking with mom
22:19 <bikcmp> oh
22:20 <`> gonna stay over a friend's, i think
22:20 <bikcmp> you or mom?
22:20 <`> me.
22:20 <bikcmp> nice
22:20 <`> i dont really want to be here, sorta.
22:20 <bikcmp> why?
22:20 <bikcmp> sue?
22:20 <`> sort of.
22:21 <`> just frustrated.
22:21 <bikcmp> oh
22:21 <bikcmp> so the whole sue thing got you worked up
22:21 <`> i went as far as to offer him a place to life
22:21 <`> *live
22:21 <`> and he halfasses it and then leaves at the end of the month
22:21 <`> ...nice.
22:21 <bikcmp> :(
22:21 <bikcmp> fwiw
22:21 <`> but
22:21 <bikcmp> he still hasn't paid me the silly $50.
22:21 <bikcmp> not that i really care
22:21 <bikcmp> but yeah
22:22 <`> he's really broke
22:22 <bikcmp> yeah
22:22 <bikcmp> i don't mind
22:22 <`> probably contributing to his 'depression' or whatever it is
22:22 <bikcmp> i didn't expect to be paid
22:22 <`> he's all fuck me i dont have car, cant go anywhere, bs
22:22 <bikcmp> i used a ton of that code in other stuff, so ;P
22:22 <bikcmp> walk!
22:22 <bikcmp> bike!
22:22 <`> exactly.
22:22 <bikcmp> hitchhike
22:22 <bikcmp> whore
22:22 <bikcmp> who cares
22:23 <`> all i know is
22:23 <`> he's not showing effort.
22:23 <`> and it's really disappointing me
22:23 <bikcmp> he just wanted a place to crash.
22:23 <`> obviously.
22:23 <bikcmp> i hate people like that.
22:23 <bikcmp> "BOO HOO MY LIFE SUCKS :((((((((("
22:23 <`> yeah
22:23 <`> my mom and sister
22:23 <bikcmp> when there are 10000's of other people who would love to have your life
22:23 <`> actually put him down
22:23 <bikcmp> huh
22:23 <`> "what a baby, what a whiner"
22:23 <bikcmp> OH
22:23 <`> i actually said fuck you out loud
22:23 <`> to them
22:23 <bikcmp> the way you said 'put him down'
22:24 <bikcmp> like
22:24 <bikcmp> if you put your dog down
22:24 <`> in defense of Sue
22:24 <bikcmp> you get what i mean?
22:24 <bikcmp> wait
22:24 <bikcmp> so they defend sue?
22:24 <`> *I* defended sue
22:24 <bikcmp> start over
22:24 <bikcmp> so
22:24 <`> sue was whining and being a baby talking to my mom and sister
22:24 <bikcmp> your mom and sister put him down
22:24 <bikcmp> and you defended sue
22:24 <`> so they put them down saying "what a whiner"
22:24 <`> so i told them fuck you
22:24 <`> and left
22:24 <`> defending Sue
22:25 <`> then today
22:25 <bikcmp> he pays you back
22:25 <bikcmp> i get it
22:25 <`> power surged a bit and killed his computer
22:25 <`> i offer to give him a line to my UPS so it doesnt happen to him
22:25 <`> then he's all ahmmmm um
22:26 <`> and then gestures (i also lipread) that he's going back up next week.
22:26 <`> i'm like ..... um ok, and just came back into my room
22:26 <bikcmp> good!
22:26 <`> and he skyped me this
22:26 <bikcmp> you don't sound like you're getting along.
22:26 <bikcmp> yeah?
22:27 <`> [7/18/12 6:31:19 PM] Zachary Hardesty: i'm sorry i'm running
22:27 <`> [7/18/12 6:31:30 PM] Zachary Hardesty: i just don't see myself getting anywhere without a car
22:27 <`> [7/18/12 6:31:36 PM] Zachary Hardesty: anywhere in life
22:27 <bikcmp> ...
22:27 <bikcmp> did he have a car before he moved there
22:27 <`> yeah.
22:27 <bikcmp> 'no'
22:27 <`> the mercedes
22:27 <bikcmp> so what changed
22:27 <bikcmp> oh?
22:27 <bikcmp> oh
22:27 <`> he was trying to fix it
22:27 <bikcmp> which he sold
22:27 <bikcmp> right?
22:27 <`> replaced it with new transmission
22:27 <`> but somehow it overdrove the engine and exploded
22:27 <bikcmp> .... lol
22:27 <`> so no car
22:27 <bikcmp> but that was before moving?
22:27 <`> yes.
22:27 <bikcmp> so what changed
22:27 <bikcmp> lol
22:28 <`> so he's all DDDDDDDDDD: about no car
22:28 <`> and not being able to go anywhere and bullshit
22:28 <`> whatever
22:28 <bikcmp> be like most people
22:28 <bikcmp> use public transport.
22:28 <bikcmp> gmaps can't make it any easier
22:28 <`> thank you
22:28 <`> i told him that
22:28 <`> he's all ehhh
22:28 <bikcmp> "it's full of black people :((((((("
22:28 <bikcmp> "buses are for minorities"
22:28 <bikcmp> right?
22:29 <bikcmp> too good for the bus
22:29 <`> no
22:29 <`> "it's too hot for that"
22:29 <bikcmp> just too lazy?
22:29 <`> i shit you not.
22:29 <bikcmp> he sounds like he's a lazy bum.
22:30 <`> he even admitted that his mother drinks every night
22:30 <bikcmp> that is what i gather from that.
22:30 <`> and he'll drink along with her getting drunk
22:30 <bikcmp> ... point?
22:30 <bikcmp> oh
22:30 <`> when he goes back
22:30 <bikcmp> well
22:30 <`> what does that tell you?
22:30 <bikcmp> dude
22:30 <bikcmp> it sounds like he has some serious problems
22:30 <`> no shit.
22:30 <bikcmp> he doesn't sound like the kind of person you want around you, to say the least.
22:30 <`> i dont mind him at all
22:30 <`> he jsut...
22:30 <bikcmp> if i were you, i would
22:30 <`> doesn't make effort
22:30 <`> thats all
22:31 <bikcmp> he sounds like a lazyass bum.
22:31 <bikcmp> just admit it.
22:31 <bikcmp> he sounds very closed-minded.
22:31 <`> i dont know him well enough, frankly.
22:31 <`> he says he doesn't want to smoke weed because he's looking for a job
22:31 <`> .....yeah
22:32 <bikcmp> 23:31:03  <`> he says he doesn't want to smoke weed because he's looking for a job
22:32 <bikcmp> tbh that's understandable
22:32 <`> yes
22:32 <bikcmp> i wouldn't be smoking any weed
22:32 <`> then he turns around and plays pc games
22:32 <bikcmp> the job part
22:32 <bikcmp> well
22:32 <bikcmp> you find jobs.
22:32 <bikcmp> they don't find you.
22:32 <`> right
22:32 <`> thank you
22:32 <bikcmp> most of the time anyway
22:32 <bikcmp> for someone like sue, yeah, they don't
22:33 <bikcmp> but i don't want to be hating on sue
22:33 <bikcmp> i mean
22:33 <bikcmp> i'm only hearing one side of the story
22:33 <bikcmp> frankly it sounds like an issue you and him need to work out.
22:33 <bikcmp> that, or have him go back to his mommy.
22:34 <`> thats exactly what i want to avoid
22:34 <`> but i have no clue of doing that.
22:35 <bikcmp> rephrase that
22:35 <bikcmp> 23:33:52  <`> but i have no clue of doing that.
22:35 <bikcmp> what do you mean?
22:35 <`> how to make him stay
22:35 <`> and learn how to deal with shit.
22:35 <`> *make him learn
22:36 <bikcmp> well
22:36 <bikcmp> it doesn't sound like you're in a position in which you can do that
22:36 <bikcmp> all you can do is hope he sees the light
22:36 <bikcmp> if he doesn't, oh well
22:36 <bikcmp> it sounds like you've done as much as you can.
22:39 <bikcmp> tbh
22:39 <bikcmp> i haven't heard from sue in forever
22:39 <bikcmp> it seems like he's ran away from me
22:41 <`> my point exactly
22:41 <`> he hasnt been on irc
22:41 <`> etc
22:41 <bikcmp> he seems depressed
22:41 <bikcmp> or like
22:41 <bikcmp> got problems.
22:41 <bikcmp> i know, no shit ;p
22:42 <bikcmp> well
22:42 <bikcmp> like i said
22:42 <bikcmp> there's nothing you can do
22:46 <`> another thing that bugs me
22:46 <bikcmp> yeah?
22:46 <`> i pretty much had to prompt him in order for him to tell me that he's moving back
22:46 <`> like, for sure
22:46 <bikcmp> yes
22:46 <bikcmp> he's being like
22:46 <bikcmp> he isn't sure
22:46 <`> no shit
22:47 <`> brb
22:47 <`> i'm getting ready
22:47 <bikcmp> to?
22:47 <bikcmp> go?
22:50 <`> my friend's, remember?
22:50 <bikcmp> oh
22:50 <bikcmp> yeah
22:50 <bikcmp> that's why i said 'go?'

15:14 <bikcmp> someone offered me $200 for irondust.net
15:15 <`> wolo.
15:15 <`> for what.
15:15 <bikcmp> the domain
15:15 <bikcmp> lol
15:15 <bikcmp> we currently have 240 users and we're dying
15:15 <bikcmp> so i'm like
15:15 <bikcmp> why the fuck not.
15:15 <`> got a replacement domain?
15:15 <bikcmp> sure, but i can't "officially" push it around
15:15 <bikcmp> i mean, i could tell my friends abut it
15:15 <bikcmp> <.<
15:15 <bikcmp> lol
15:16 <bikcmp> connectgate.net
15:16 <`> so why not get a real .com?
15:16 <bikcmp> .com is for business
15:16 <bikcmp> .net is for networks
15:16 <`> doesn't matter
15:16 <bikcmp> personally it hink it looks nicer
15:16 <`> it's all end-user perception
15:17 <bikcmp> ikr
15:17 <`> .com is plain more popular and understandable.
15:17 <bikcmp> well
15:17 <bikcmp> i originally was planning on using connectgate for a server host
15:17 <bikcmp> and am as we peak
