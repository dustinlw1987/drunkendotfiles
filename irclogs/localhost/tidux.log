14:58 <tidux> ok here
14:58 <tidux> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ed9a7b0fdcf9245598179ac4fa752d82dc80f5b9&dn=linux-3.7.2-tidux.tar.gz
14:59 <`> lol
14:59 <tidux> I'm seeding this from my own laptop
14:59 <tidux> fuck trackers
14:59 <`> >mfw magnet link
14:59 <tidux> it's 500MB
14:59 <tidux> of open source data
14:59 <`> how difficult is it to roll my own?
14:59 <tidux> exactly what bittorrent was meant to enable
15:00 <tidux> not difficult
15:00 <tidux> just time consuming
15:00 <`> i kinda wanted linux-3.2.7-dissimulo
15:00 <`> ;)
15:00 <tidux> oh
15:00 <tidux> well then
15:00 <`> typo on ver, but you get what i mean
15:00 <`> but regardless, i'll grab your magnet
15:00 <tidux> I'll just sprunge my .config and then you s/tidux/dissimulo/ and run 'make deb-pkg -j $NUMBER_OF_CORES'
15:00 <`> that's it?
15:00 <tidux> yeah
15:01 <`> sweet.
15:01 <`> please.
15:01 <tidux> well you'll need the upstream 3.7.2 source
15:01 <tidux> fetch, boy
15:01 <`> that, i can do.
15:01 <`> do this as root?
15:01 <tidux> the make command yes
15:01 <tidux> everything else no
15:01 <`> kay, lets see.
15:02 <`> wow
15:02 <tidux>  http://sprunge.us/FHOS <== wget into top level of source tree as .config
15:02 <`> there's already 3.7.4
15:02 <tidux> wow
15:03 <`> what do? :P
15:04 <tidux> get the 3.7.4 and run "make menuconfig" to pick your own options off a nice 'dialog' menu system
15:04 <`> i can apparently get linux-3.7.2.tar.gz
15:04 <tidux> the local version string is where you can add -dissimulo
15:04 <`> i'll probably fuck it up
15:04 <`> lol
15:04 <tidux> if you're that concerned just grab 3.7.2 and use my .config
15:05 <`> because i dont know linux THAT well to know what the kernel might need
15:05 <tidux> honestly it's mostly picking device drivers
15:05 <`> so i'll probably be all fatginering it
15:05 <`> ah.
15:05 <tidux> schedulers, memory, etc. are just left alone IMO
15:05 <tidux> you get to choose what's baked in to the kernel and what's left as a module
15:05 <tidux> brotip: leave everything as a module if you can
15:05 <tidux> except for like 
15:05 <tidux> filesystems
15:05 <tidux> things you really actually need to boot
15:06 <`> okay
15:06 <`> i'll try grabbing 3.7.4
15:06 <`> and see what i can fuck up
15:06 <tidux> and don't worry if you fuck it up
15:06 <tidux> if you install it as a Debian package it just adds it to your GRUB menu automatically
15:07 <tidux> if it fucks up, reboot into the old kernel, aptitude purge the new one, and start over
15:07 <`> okies.
15:07 <`> grabbing 3.7.4
15:07 <`> continue this convo in #wtfpwnt?
15:08 <tidux> sure

08:31 <tidux> can someone with +o here kickban him?
08:31 <tidux> chanserv is down
08:33 <`> heh
08:33 <`>  /killing him is much more entertaining
08:33 <tidux> it gets old
08:33 <tidux> I'd rather he just stop shitting up the channel
08:34 <`> lol
08:34 <tidux> and mike gimped my o-line so I can't ban him outright
08:34 <`> knowing jewform
08:34 <`> he'll just bitch
08:35 <`> just write a script
08:35 <`> that automatically /kills him
08:35 <`> after 3s of join
08:35 <tidux> ugh fine
08:35 <tidux> no
08:35 <tidux> instakill
08:35 <`> lol fine
08:35 <tidux> we need server rules that if you /join more than ten times a minute you're banned for a month
08:35 <`> its your funeral
08:35 <tidux> because only gnuform does that
08:37 <tidux> dammit
08:38 <`> lol
08:38 <tidux> I need chanops to make an autokicker work
08:38  * tidux grumbles
08:38 <`> you shouldn't
08:38 <tidux> I can't gline or kickban
08:38 <tidux> at all
08:38 <tidux> :/
08:38 <`> just make an manual script
08:38 <`> that does a basic grep for any *ewform*
08:38 <`> then automatically calling /kill
08:39 <`> that way, it relies on your client only, and not on external priveleges (other than /oper, but you can have the script to oper up first in case, even)
08:39 <tidux> true
08:40 <`> nod
08:41 <tidux> ` can you just give me +o in #wtfpwnt?
08:42 <tidux> that way I have a working banscript while I hack my replacement together
