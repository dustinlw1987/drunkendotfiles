22:06 <Sue> i know this is cliche, but use backtrack
22:06 <`> BCM94313
22:06 <`> why.
22:07 <Sue> because i don't want to custom compile a kernel for that thing to support that chip
22:07 <Sue> and backtrack doesn't need installation
22:07 <`> can you get me a stick with the latest backtrack?
22:07 <Sue> yeah

01:56 <Sue> your mom works during the week
01:56 <Sue> i have to get to riverside to catch the bus
01:57 <`> nonissue
01:57 <Sue> doesn't that mean i have to leave during the weekend?
01:57 <`> again, nonissue:
01:58 <`> 309, 9, 215 will take you directly to Riverside Downtown terminal, which also is where Greyhound is.
01:58 <Sue> i don't have bus money
01:58 <Sue> and
01:58 <Sue> i have to take luggage
01:58 <Sue> i'm not taking all that shit on the bus
01:58 <`> we'll figure it out
01:58 <`> we'll talk to mom tomorrow, cool?
01:59 <Sue> alright
01:59 <`> more than likely she'll give you a ride
01:59 <Sue> isn't she awake still?
01:59 <`> probably. but i kinda dont want to bother her
01:59 <`> she was up since 5am today
01:59 <Sue> oh and the other thing
01:59 <`> sup?
01:59 <Sue> the other reason i'm saying it might need to be the weekend, the most direct and cheapest route leaves at 1:30pm
02:00 <`> of which day?
02:00 <Sue> the whole week
02:00 <`> no no
02:00 <`> departing when?
02:00 <Sue> the whole week
02:00 <Sue> at 1:30
02:00 <`> yeah, well
02:00 <`> we'll figure it out
02:00 <Sue> the most viable time would be during the weekend when she's off
02:01 <`> well
02:01 <Sue> it also departs saturday, same price
02:01 <Sue> sunday it goes up 20 bucks
02:01 <`> saturday would be the least hassle, yeah
02:01 <Sue> so tomorrow would be clean and pack
02:01 <`> sounds good
02:01 <Sue> can you help me? sorry to impose
02:01 <`> yeah
02:01 <Sue> thanks
02:02 <`> i hate to ask, but can we switch your system out of the 4U so i can put something in it and use it in the rack
02:02 <Sue> i'll pull the mobo out sure
02:02 <Sue> i'm not taking it anyway
02:02 <Sue> i'm pulling the hdd and leaving the rest behind
02:02 <`> oh the system?
02:02 <`> hmm, can i borrow it?
02:02 <Sue> yeah i was kinda implying that
02:03 <`> :D okay, sounds good
02:03 <Sue> i'm taking only my lcd and my hdd
02:03 <Sue> and maybe a few other things
02:03 <`> alright
02:03 <Sue> the rest gets stored in the 40 gallon bins
02:03 <`> yeah, i thought so.

10:35 <Sue> hey
10:35 <`> \o
10:35 <Sue> i'm not gonna be able to fully come clean on why i left
10:36 <`> ah.
10:36 <Sue> but i want you to know that i'm incredibly sorry about something that went on in my head
10:36 <`> what's up?
10:36 <Sue> it
10:36 <Sue> it's better left unsaid really, has nothing to do with you
10:37 <`> its cool, you can tell me
10:37 <Sue> short answer: i had a mental breakdown
10:37 <`> i sorta could tell
10:37 <Sue> >closing hh
10:37 <`> yeah, etc
10:37 <Sue> that wouldn't normally happen
10:37 <`> but i truly want to know what happened/why you left
10:38 <Sue> and now hh is practially dead and the previous avenues i had for it are now closed
10:38 <Sue> there are a bunch of reasons, some i know will piss you off
10:38 <Sue> some you already know
10:38 <Sue> oh
10:39 <Sue> about the not waking you up
10:39 <Sue> part of that was shame on my part
10:39 <`> ah. well, i just want to know, i wont get mad
10:39 <Sue> i don't like looking back when i'm running from my troubles
10:39 <Sue> i'm very selfish
10:40 <`> i kinda noticed.
10:40 <`> but i was fine with that
10:40 <`> to each his own, but yeah
10:40 <Sue> but uh
10:41 <Sue> yeah, i'm not ready for the real world yet
10:41 <Sue> i say regressed a year, i only had a year of growth in the past four
10:41 <Sue> i'm literally back in high school (in my head)
10:42 <`> ah
10:42 <Sue> (i'm in the middle of some weird epiphany)
10:42 <Sue> (please don't mind the strange rambling)
10:42 <`> not at all, go on.
10:43 <Sue> i got a good night's sleep
10:43 <Sue> and woke up in this
10:43 <Sue> and just to detail what i mean by literally back in high school
10:43 <Sue> i've spent the past week at my high school friend's house, playing Anarchy Online (spent all of high school playing)
10:45 <Sue> i'm such a fucking child
10:47 <`> i think it's a conciscous choice when you move on to other things
10:47 <Sue> oh and mac is a middle ground between windows and linux
10:48 <Sue> i'm not going to drink the hardware kool-aid but the software is pretty great to hack with
10:49 <`> see why i like using my mac, then?
10:49 <Sue> (i've been using a macbook pro late 2010 17", the hardware looks nice but LOL the fans blow hot air straight onto the screen, it's already got heat deformation)
10:50 <`> i've got the mid-2009 13-inch
10:50 <Sue> if you put any sort of blockage whatsoever behind the lower vent, it vents through the top part of the hinge and hits the screen
10:50 <Sue> it's pretty hilarious
10:50 <`> yeah, thats how it is for mine, but no heat deformation
10:50 <Sue> it's really bad on this one
10:51 <`> how'd you get a mbp?
10:51 <Sue> it's my friends, he just got the rMBP
10:51 <`> rich, eh
10:51 <Sue> yeah
10:51 <Sue> lemme tell you, that's one fucked up resolution
10:51 <`> the rMBP?
10:52 <Sue> yeah
10:52 <`> how so
10:52 <Sue> well, it's quad res on a 15in screen
10:52 <Sue> i can't even read it
10:53 <`> lols
10:53 <Sue> but that's also because i'm a blind fuck
