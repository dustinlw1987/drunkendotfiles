18:58 <@dissimulo> mmkay.
18:58 <@bikcmp> hi
18:59 <@bikcmp> Marketh: this is him.
18:59 <@Marketh> hi
18:59 <@dissimulo> \o
18:59 <@bikcmp> Marketh: he's a cool guy.
18:59 <@dissimulo> ...and deaf, ;)
18:59 <@Marketh> I'm selectively deaf, does that count?
18:59 <@dissimulo> haha
18:59 <@Marketh> :D
19:00 <@dissimulo> every time i see JStoker, i think Bram Stoker's Dracula
19:01  * dissimulo shrugs
19:01 <@bikcmp> JStoker's the brain ;p
19:01 <@bikcmp> but he's also idle as hell
19:01 <@bikcmp> he's the smartest person i know, though
19:01 <@Marketh> aren't we all idle as hell
19:02 <@dissimulo> heh
19:02 <@dissimulo> this irssi instance is on a server, even.
19:02 <@dissimulo> so i detach the screen and idle for days at a time, sometimes
19:03 <@bikcmp> yes
19:03 <@bikcmp> :p
19:03 <@bikcmp> same
19:03 <@dissimulo> i'm mostly an backdoor admin.
19:04 <@dissimulo> something fucks up, i go in and fix, and nobody's the wiser.
19:04 <@bikcmp> maybe you could fix Marketh's backdoor.
19:04 <@dissimulo> my modes are insane on my server
19:04 <@dissimulo> bikcmp: lol
19:04 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: 
19:04 <@bikcmp> 19:20:55   * Zanzibar wants everyone to enjoy 4:20 right now!. It's the perfect time to celebrate! Relax, Enjoy, and Live High! Happy 4:20 Everyone!
19:04 <@bikcmp> 20:02:53  < bikcmp> lives in a box ^
19:05 <@bikcmp> anyway.  
19:05 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: so, like we were discussing
19:05 <@bikcmp> i want to reset stuff re: spitfire back to the way it was july 6
19:05 <@bikcmp> the day before this happened
19:09 <@dissimulo> yeah.
19:10 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: ok, i guess i'll do it
19:10 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: first, kill spit, i guess
19:11 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i hope you aren't relaying logs
19:11 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: 20:09:42  -!- Sue [~sue@bitch/Sue] has joined #hh

19:11 <@bikcmp> 20:09:56  <@Sue> mail.hh or nagisa itself
19:11 <@dissimulo> yeah i know
19:11 <@bikcmp> look who's there
19:11 <@dissimulo> i told him
19:12 <@dissimulo> also, my typical way of /killing is to first /oper up
19:12 <@dissimulo> what's the exact procedure here?
19:12 <@bikcmp> oh.
19:12 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: i was going to do it
19:12 <@bikcmp> but, uh
19:12 <@bikcmp> yeah
19:12 <@bikcmp> lol
19:12 <@dissimulo> i'm a unrealircd dude, remember
19:12 <@dissimulo> :P
19:12 <@dissimulo> but yeah
19:12 <@bikcmp> that sucks!
19:12 <@dissimulo> no it doesn't
19:12 <@dissimulo> i love unreal
19:12 <@dissimulo> :D
19:12 <@bikcmp> get out
19:12 <@dissimulo> noep
19:12 <@dissimulo> :p
19:13 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: what should the k: message be
19:13 <@dissimulo> hmm.
19:13 <@dissimulo> good question.
19:13 <@bikcmp> i'm thinking
19:14 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: "You have violated the user conduct policy.  Please read http://www.irondust.net/UserConductPolicy.  Email kline@irondust.net to appeal."
19:14 <@dissimulo> sounds democratic and fair, yeah.
19:14 <@dissimulo> go ahead.
19:14 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: i always add the email in there.
19:15 <@bikcmp> i want you to too
19:15 <@Marketh> why are you killing him for?
19:15 <@bikcmp> Marketh: he's done tons of shit.
19:15 <@dissimulo> spamming/flooding, chiefly.
19:15 <@Marketh> Since the removal from staff?
19:15 <@bikcmp> yes.
19:15 <@Marketh> Where was he doing that?
19:15 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i've seen logs of him asking people to flood.
19:15 <@dissimulo> #help from the logs i was shown
19:15 <@Marketh> bikcmp, sorry but I'm not convinced until I know how you even know those logs are real
19:16 <@Marketh> and who they are from and who he asked
19:16 <@Marketh> I could type up a fake irc log right now with you telling people you are black with pink spots and you love sucking cock
19:16 <@Marketh> that doesn't mean it's real
19:16 <@bikcmp> i'm not foolish enough to reveal who told me that info
19:16 <@Marketh> then why should you believe it's real?
19:16 <@bikcmp> i have good reason to suspect it's real.
19:16 <@Marketh> suspect? So you are not 100% sure
19:16 <@Marketh> seems legit
19:17 <@dissimulo> i would also suggest you guys put logging bots in most channels.
19:17 <@Marketh> your suspecting is pretty biased considering what has happened
19:17 <@bikcmp> no
19:17 <@dissimulo> this way, everything is verifiable
19:17 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: xanos does log channels in an anonymous way
19:17 <@dissimulo> so check against that
19:17 <@Marketh> dissimulo, nothing is reliable if the staff can't trust eachother and won't even share sources of information
19:17 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: well
19:17 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: it doens't log the person who said it
19:17 <@bikcmp> nor the order of what it was said
19:17 <@bikcmp> nor where it was said
19:17 <@bikcmp> lol
19:17 <@dissimulo> yeah.
19:18 <@dissimulo> that's an issue.
19:18 <@dissimulo> i would just shove an eggdrop logging bot
19:18 <@dissimulo> and call it "stats"
19:18 <@dissimulo> and the end result is that everything gets logged.
19:18 <@bikcmp> eh
19:18 <@bikcmp> i wouldn't
19:18 <@dissimulo> thats what i do on my other network, users love it
19:18 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: xanos also loosely monitors channels it isn't in
19:18 <@dissimulo> and i end up having a neutral source of logs
19:18 <@bikcmp> but it doesn't log the content of messages.
19:19 <@bikcmp> Marketh: additionally, it's the exact same nicks that nightmare used to hit #smbx.
19:19 <@bikcmp> they match.
19:20 <@Marketh> can I at least see the logs you claim prove it?
19:20 <@Marketh> as far as I'm aware, you've already shown Tarlach
19:20 <@bikcmp> sigh
19:20 <@bikcmp> if you want
19:20 <@bikcmp> give me 5 minutes to find them.
19:22 <@dissimulo> Marketh: i'm relatively new here; I came in via #hh
19:22 <@bikcmp> Marketh: ok
19:23 <@bikcmp> Marketh: what do you want from logs.
19:23 <@Marketh> Whatever it is that supposedly proves spitfire is the cause of the flooding etc
19:23 <@Marketh> Just show me what you showed Tarlach
19:23 <@Marketh> If it was enough to convince him
19:24 <@bikcmp> sigh
19:24 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i showed tarlach a /lot/ of logs
19:24 <@bikcmp> but ok
19:25 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: watch too, if you care
19:25 <@Marketh> grrrr, wish i never changed client
19:25  * dissimulo pets irssi
19:26 <@bikcmp> Marketh: ok
19:26 <@bikcmp> Send: Anyway, would you like to explain what happened?
19:26 <@bikcmp> <Spitfire> No, not really.
19:26 <@bikcmp> <Spitfire> There's not really anything to explain.
19:26 <@bikcmp> <Spitfire> And in any case I'd rather just move on.
19:26 <@bikcmp> dissimulo, too
19:26 <@dissimulo> yeah.
19:26 <@dissimulo> go ahead.
19:26 <@bikcmp> Send: I'd at least like a reason as to why a flood was initated from 2 of my boxes
19:26 <@bikcmp> <Spitfire> A reason?
19:26 <@bikcmp> <Spitfire> I don't think there is any reason.
19:26 <@bikcmp> Send: was it knowingly executed by you, or someone designated to terminate connections on your box?
19:26 <@bikcmp> <Spitfire> Is this necessary?
19:26 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: this was done through another host
19:27 <@bikcmp> he didn't know it was me.
19:27 <@dissimulo> hm.
19:28 <@Marketh> this isn't really proving anything
19:28 <@Marketh> Yet
19:29 <@bikcmp> ok
19:29 <@bikcmp> Marketh: sorry i'm multitasking as hel
19:29 <@bikcmp> l
19:30 <@alyx> hi
19:30 <@alyx> dissimulo: hi
19:31 <@alyx> dissimulo: welcome to hell
19:31 <@alyx> erm, I mean #staff 
19:31 <@bikcmp> same thing
19:31 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: so
19:31 <@alyx> p much :P
19:31 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: after that
19:31 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: 03:51:57 <bikcmp> 03:51:36  <@Spitfire> I think if you have an issue then you should approach me  about it.
19:31 <@bikcmp> 03:51:57 <bikcmp> 03:51:41  <@Spitfire> There's nothing unfair in that.
19:31 <@bikcmp> 03:51:57 <bikcmp> 03:51:45  <@bikcmp> Spitfire: i already did.
19:34 <@Marketh> I'm not really sure what that is meant to be showing?
19:35 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i'm going through a /lot/ of logs.
19:35 <@Marketh> I get that, I'm just saying the last one seems out of context somehow
19:35 <@Marketh> remember the logs are meant to be proving something, I don't really get what these are proving so far
19:35 <@bikcmp> Marketh: ok
19:35 <@bikcmp> Marketh: what do you want me to prove
19:35 <@bikcmp> that may help.
19:36 <@Marketh> ok start with the flooding thing then. You said you had logged proof of spitfire asking a friend to flood the network or something?
19:36 <@bikcmp> i don't want to share those, since it'd be easy to tell who gave them
19:36 <@bikcmp> rest assured, i have them.
19:37 <@Marketh> Censor out whatever it is that could give away who it is from?
19:37 <@Marketh> Which friend of Spitfire was it that he asked to flood the network, then?
19:38 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i don't want to share this information.  it would be /very/ easy to figure out who it is.
19:38 <@Marketh> honestly, this has been a total failure so far. I simply asked for logs of proof and all you've managed to do is show old logs that I've already seen that prove absolutely nothing
19:38 <@Marketh> :/
19:39 <@bikcmp> sigh
19:43 <@Marketh> just to point out
19:43 <@Marketh> [01:18:51] <Marketh> can I at least see the logs you claim prove it?
19:43 <@Marketh> [01:18:57] <Marketh> as far as I'm aware, you've already shown Tarlach
19:43 <@Marketh> [01:19:28] <bikcmp> sigh
19:43 <@Marketh> [01:19:30] <bikcmp> if you want
19:43 <@Marketh> [01:19:34] <bikcmp> give me 5 minutes to find them.
19:43 <@Marketh> you are either going to show the proof or not
19:43 <@bikcmp> i've found logs of spitfire not doing bullshit when he saw floods from his girlfriend
19:43 <@bikcmp> and dodging questions about the floods.
19:43 <@bikcmp> and being a jerk.
19:44 <@Marketh> Considering what you put him through I am not surprised he is deliberately trying to avoid you
19:44 <@Marketh> But that doesn't prove he is guilty
19:44 <@Marketh> and that's irrelevant
19:44 <@Marketh> We are talking about the recent floods
19:44 <@Marketh> after he was removed from staff
19:44 <@Marketh> You are going off-topic
19:44 <@Marketh> You said you were going to show proof and to give you 5 minutes
19:44 <@bikcmp> are you just trying to give me a hard time?
19:45 <@Marketh> but all you've shown is old logs that I've already seen, then said you WON'T show proof
19:45 <@Marketh> bikcmp, not at all
19:45 <@Marketh> I actually want to see the proof you claim that you have
19:45 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i won't show proof of the floods so that i still can see logs of him doing stuff.
19:45 <@bikcmp> if i show them to you now it jeopardizes future logs.
19:45 <@Marketh> I have heard it from both Spitfire and Nightmare personally, as close friends, that neither of them have done anything against the network since then. I have no reason not to believe them, which is why I want proof that they did anything before I am going to take sides
19:45 <@bikcmp> i'm not asking you to take a side
19:45 <@Marketh> I know you are not
19:46 <@Marketh> but they ar enot such great friends of mine if they are going to lie to me and put me in the middle of this shit
19:46 <@Marketh> Which is why I want to know where I stand. I want to know if they did something wrong.
19:46 <@Marketh> But as far as I can tell so far, they haven't done anything wrong. And you haven't been able to proove otherwise
19:46 <@Marketh> Even when you said you were going to show me proof, you then said you were not going to show me proof.
19:47 <@bikcmp> sigh.
19:47 <@bikcmp> Marketh: fine.
19:47 <@bikcmp> Send: so, are you aware of what's been going on with both of the boxes lately, and massive numbers of irc clones? :)
19:48 <@bikcmp> <Nightmare> There wasn't that many of them, maybe 10 at msot
19:48 <@bikcmp> Send: yes, I know how many there were
19:48 <@bikcmp> Send: Can I note that if you continue to do this, that there will be consequences?
19:48 <@bikcmp> Send: I feel that this is a violation of our TOS
19:48 <@bikcmp> <Nightmare> Yeah, I understand that everyone is pissed off over it. But what was so wrong with it? It wasn't like I was conducting ddos attacks on irondust or something
19:48 <@bikcmp> Send: floodbots is a form of attack on channels
19:49 <@bikcmp>  <Nightmare> The only person that minded was bikcmp, and everyone else there thought it was pretty funny, actually.
19:49 <@bikcmp> 22:36:50 <bikcmp> i see nothing funny with spamming a channel for 3 hours
19:49 <@bikcmp> 22:36:59 <bikcmp> while wasting bandwidth that our sponsors pay for
19:49 <@bikcmp> 22:37:22 <bikcmp> 19:59:18  < Joey> Kyafire: you should've been here earlier
19:49 <@bikcmp> 22:37:22 <bikcmp> 19:59:26  < Joey> nightmare flooded the channel for a good 2 hours
19:49 <@bikcmp> 22:37:28 <bikcmp> 20:00:54  < Joey> she fucking brought in a botnet
19:49 <@bikcmp> 23:58:32 <Dan> Nightmare is now interested in reading our TOS, which I am about to update
19:49 <@bikcmp> Marketh: proof enough.
19:49 <@bikcmp> <Dan> I see a large ammount or irc traffic outgoing, somebody posts about a flood in smbx, and then bikcmp posts the ip in smbx
19:50 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: for what it's worth, here?
19:50 <@bikcmp> Marketh, too
19:50 <@bikcmp> Marketh: someone wants to host a qwebirc for id.
19:51 <@bikcmp> he gave me all of his contact details. at first i'm like, i'll give you an iline.
19:51 <@bikcmp> though, it might be really useful to have qwebirc.
19:51 <@bikcmp> especially if i don't need to manage it.
19:51 <@bikcmp> thoughts about giving him a cgiirc block?
19:51 <@Marketh> sorry, also multitasking
19:51 <@Marketh> heh
19:51 <@Marketh> ok reading now
19:51 <@bikcmp> Marketh: one thing to note
19:51 <@bikcmp> Marketh: some of that wasn't sent by me.
19:54 <@Marketh> bikcmp, isn't that related to the original flooding?
19:54 <@Marketh> Not the recent flooding
19:54 <@bikcmp> yes
19:54 <@bikcmp> like i said, i will not release the logs for the recent floods.
19:54 <@bikcmp> sorry, won't happen
19:54 <@Marketh> That is the proof I wanted, and you knew it was
19:55 <@Marketh> We all already knew Nightmare was the cause of the original flooding, that is news to nobody
19:55 <@bikcmp> Marketh: this is all the proof i'm willing to give out.
19:55 <@bikcmp> i figured you want this over nothing.
19:55 <@Marketh> Then as far as I'm concerned you are unable to prove nothing :/
19:55 <@bikcmp> suit yourself
19:55 <@Marketh> All you've been able to do is show old logs of information that is already largely known publically
19:56 <@bikcmp> ok
19:56 <@Marketh> I already made it clear enough that I wanted proof of how it could have been spitfire or nightmare that caused the recent flooding
19:56 <@bikcmp> ... cool
19:56 <@Marketh> Surely as staff we should all have the right to see the proof if it is concerning banning somebody
19:57 <@Marketh> It seems very one-sided if it all comes down to one persons decision
19:57 <@bikcmp> w56
19:58 <@bikcmp> Marketh: for what it's worth
19:58 <@bikcmp> i did not make that decision singlehandedly.
19:58 <@bikcmp> i made it with a vote of 3 people who watched what happened.
19:58 <@Marketh> The vote should be between staff
19:58 <@Marketh> Did anyone else here vote? JStoker? alyx ?
19:59 <@bikcmp> one person who was in here voted.
19:59 <@bikcmp> in fact
19:59 <@bikcmp> all 3 were at one time staff.
19:59 <@Marketh> wait wait
19:59 <@Marketh> "at one time"
19:59 <@bikcmp> yes.
19:59 <@Marketh> They were not staff at the time of voting?
19:59 <@bikcmp> it wasn't really a vote vote
19:59 <@Marketh> wait wait
19:59 <@Marketh> let me get this straight
19:59 <@bikcmp> it was more a "do you think i should do this"
19:59 <@Marketh> you held a vote with people were are EX-STAFF
19:59 <@bikcmp> yep
20:00 <@Marketh> you didn't even discuss this with the other ACTUAL staff members of this network
20:00 <@Marketh> you didn't show them the logs, you didn't hold a vote with them
20:00 <@Marketh> instead, you held a vote with people who are NOT staff
20:00 <@bikcmp> i showed the logs i was showing the others.
20:00 <@Marketh> ho w is that even valid
20:00 <@Marketh> holding a vote to ban somebody from this network with people who are not even staff?
20:00 <@alyx> what did we vote about?
20:00 <@bikcmp> nothing at all
20:00 <@bikcmp> lol
20:00 <@Marketh> alyx, we didnt' vote about anything
20:00 <@Marketh> staff members were not even involved
20:00 <@alyx> oh
20:00 <@alyx> Marketh: on which topic
20:01 <@bikcmp> alyx: 'kill spitfire or just lynch him'
20:01 <@alyx> bikcmp: oh
20:01 <@Marketh> to do with banning Spitfire for APPARENTLY flooding the network
20:01 <@Marketh> after his kline
20:01 <@Marketh> bikcmp refuses to show logged proof that he claims to have
20:01 <@bikcmp> uh
20:01 <@bikcmp> no
20:01 <@bikcmp> alyx: i have logs of spitfire asking someone to flood.
20:01 <@alyx> i see
20:01 <@Marketh> Which he refuses to share with other staff members
20:01 <@bikcmp> i won't give them out since if spitfire or someone who shouldn't see it ever saw them, they'd know who it is.
20:01 <@Marketh> bikcmp, but this is a matter that concerns staff
20:02 <@Marketh> The fact that you have gone behind OUR back and instead discussed and voted with people who are NOT staff
20:02 <@Marketh> That totally makes the vote invalid
20:02 <@Marketh> You won't even share the claimed proof that you have

16:22 <@bikcmp> JStoker: was about to
16:23 <@bikcmp> i thought there's 3.4 final?
16:23 <@JStoker> bikcmp, as far as i'm aware, it's only release candidate. if it's been actually released though, go ahead
16:23 <@bikcmp> oh?
16:23 <@bikcmp> hmm.
16:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'll look
16:23 <@bikcmp> in all fairness
16:23 <@bikcmp> atheme's "release canidate" is like, production

20:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's watching the rate of which you send messages
20:29 <@bikcmp> it doesn't see the content ;p
20:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: basically
20:29 <@bikcmp> if it sees a charybdis flood warning, and the user has $points or higher, it akills.

22:59 <@bikcmp> lol
23:00 <@bikcmp> uuid1, uuid4, or riakcs
23:00 <@bikcmp> lol
23:01 <@Dan> I'm trying to figure out the cheapest way to build a mic stand, since my banana holder idea is not flexible enough, since it requires the mic to be taped in place. my new mic has a clip that can be attached to a stand, but I am not buying a stand
23:01 <@bikcmp> lol
23:01 <@bikcmp> buy one ;p
23:02 <@Dan> I could prolly buy enough parts at lowes for 5 bucks to make one that beats all the store bought stands
23:03 <@bikcmp> Dan: 
23:03 <@bikcmp> 00:01:26  < bikcmp> evanmcc: what's the best way to make a uid that is so  unique i'm more likely to die than it produce a duplicate?
23:03 <@bikcmp> lol
23:03 <@Dan> depends on how likely you are to die
23:04  * bikcmp looks around
23:04 <@bikcmp> lol
23:05 <@bikcmp> hm
23:05 <@bikcmp> power might die.

15:38 <@bikcmp> h/13
15:39 <@dissimulo> huh.
15:39 <@dissimulo> i noticed that, yeah.
15:39 <@dissimulo> if i can find $80
15:39 <@dissimulo> i can get you a complete server that you can use
15:40 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: well
15:40 <@dissimulo> a Dell PowerEdge 2300
15:40 <@dissimulo> :D
15:40 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: i don't need one urgently, really: if i really needed to i could use the ones i have at home
15:40 <@bikcmp> but my isp is shit
15:40 <@dissimulo> :P
15:40 <@dissimulo> yeah
15:40 <@bikcmp> i have 2 really awesome servers.
15:40 <@dissimulo> actually
15:40 <@dissimulo> once sue moves out
15:40 <@dissimulo> he's leaving his system behind
15:40 <@bikcmp> why?
15:40 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: and, isn't he moving like tomorrow
15:40 <@dissimulo> tomorrow, yes.
15:41 <@bikcmp> when's the party?
15:41 <@dissimulo> he has to take the bus
15:41 <@bikcmp> lol
15:41 <@bikcmp> LOL
15:41 <@bikcmp> HAHAHAHAHA
15:41 <@bikcmp> he's taking the bus?
15:41 <@bikcmp> hahahahaha
15:41 <@dissimulo> so he has to leave almost 90% of his shit here
15:41 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: for good?
15:41 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: can't he just pay ups like, $50
15:41 <@bikcmp> and they'll do it
15:41 <@bikcmp> and ship it back up
15:41 <@dissimulo> no, apparently he's planning to come back down
15:41 <@bikcmp> he's like dirt broke though, isn't he
15:41 <@bikcmp> dude
15:41 <@dissimulo> because he has... "issues"
15:42 <@dissimulo> with his bio parents
15:42 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: the cost to drive down and back exceeds the cost to just ship
15:42 <@dissimulo> so he's going back up just to fix those socalled issues
15:42 <@bikcmp> ... 
15:42 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: i'd just kick him out
15:42 <@bikcmp> say "you have until tomorrow, get out"
15:42 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: he sounds like a prick.
15:42 <@dissimulo> no
15:42 <@dissimulo> he's not
15:42 <@dissimulo> i can personally see that he has 'issues'
15:43 <@dissimulo> he has a VERY hard time with confrontations
15:43 <@bikcmp> it doesn't take a genius to see that
15:43 <@dissimulo> i.e.
15:43 <@dissimulo> i argued with my mom
15:43 <@dissimulo> (think huge waving hands in anger and my mom yelling)
15:43 <@dissimulo> and sue was all scaredbaby
15:43 <@bikcmp> lol
15:43 <@dissimulo> so, whatever, let him sort out his shit
15:44 <@bikcmp> server=xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://accounts.irondust.net/api")
15:44 <@bikcmp> er.
15:44 <@dissimulo> and if he comes back down here to room again, great, but im not gonna hold his hand
15:44 <@dissimulo> he's gotta do his side of things
15:44 <@dissimulo> apparently he'll get another car secondhand from his mom
15:44 <@dissimulo> another reason he wants to go back up
15:44 <@bikcmp> dude
15:44 <@dissimulo> honestly
15:44 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: or he could just like
15:44 <@bikcmp> get a job
15:45 <@bikcmp> like a normal person
15:45 <@dissimulo> that.
15:45 <@dissimulo> but im not gonna hold his hand right now
15:45 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: i probably make more money than he does
15:45 <@dissimulo> i just want him to gtfo and fix his shit
15:45 <@bikcmp> seriously
15:45 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: how much does he make a week
15:45 <@dissimulo> the only reason i'm not bitching at him
15:45 <@dissimulo> is because he's letting me use his shit
15:45 <@dissimulo> while hes gone
15:45 <@bikcmp> wtf
15:45 <@bikcmp> alyx: Invalid authentation token: ApplicationError: 5
15:45 <@bikcmp> how the fuck does that happen
15:45 <@alyx> lol
15:46 <@dissimulo> thats why i offered you to use his system as a server once he leaves
15:46 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: for $80?
15:46 <@bikcmp> alyx: hi, ahNzfmlyb25kdXN0LWFjY291bnRzcg0LEgVVc2VycxiLoQIM (bikcmp)

15:46 <@dissimulo> rackmount or desktop?

15:47 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: the cost to ship would be a lot of money
15:47 <@dissimulo> for your ircd if the 4U system
15:47 <@dissimulo> doesnt work out
15:47 <@dissimulo> (i doubt it'd *not* work out)

15:51 <@dissimulo> like this
15:51 <@dissimulo> http://www.teeshirtoc.com/images/motifs/motif-fed-up.gif
15:51 <@dissimulo> without the symbol at the end
15:51 <@bikcmp> hah
15:52 <@dissimulo> ;)
15:52 <@dissimulo> i like to make people take double-takes
15:52 <@dissimulo> like make something VERY different... VERY subtly
15:52 <@dissimulo> like
15:52 <@dissimulo> i have two pairs of shoes
15:52 <@dissimulo> exactly the same
15:53 <@dissimulo> except one pair is tan; another is grey
15:53 <@dissimulo> so i wear both tan and grey
15:53 <@bikcmp>     if used:
15:53 <@bikcmp>         return "Someone already has that username."
15:53 <@bikcmp>     elif len(username) <= 1:
15:53 <@bikcmp>         return "Your username is too short."
15:53 <@bikcmp>     elif len(username) > 20:
15:53 <@bikcmp>         return "Your username is too long."
15:53 <@bikcmp>     elif username[0] not in string.letters:
15:53 <@bikcmp>         return "Usernames must start with a letter."
15:53 <@bikcmp>     for c in username:
15:53 <@bikcmp>         if c not in allowedchars:
15:53 <@bikcmp>             return "Invalid character in username: "+c
15:53 <@bikcmp> argggg
15:53 <@dissimulo> and people would make double-takes every time
15:53 <@dissimulo> }:A
15:53 <@dissimulo> and make a face like, "lol oh u."
15:53 <@bikcmp> alyx: i hate sanity checking for real
15:53 <@bikcmp> this sucks
15:54 <@dissimulo> lol, yeah
15:54 <@dissimulo> those elseifs are annoying
15:54 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: no
15:54 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: if request.form.has_key("email") and request.form.has_key("fname") and request.form.has_key("username") and request.form.has_key("password") and request.form.has_key("password2"):
15:54 <@bikcmp> lol
15:54 <@dissimulo> im talking about elseifs used for sanity checking
15:54 <@dissimulo> ;)
15:55 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: well
15:55 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: in 4 weeks i made the account system hold user data in a redundanter db
15:55 <@bikcmp> generate it's own uids
15:55 <@bikcmp> and pretty much work
15:55 <@bikcmp> hi, ahNzfmlyb25kdXN0LWFjY291bnRzcg0LEgVVc2VycxiLoQIM (bikcmp)
15:55 <@bikcmp> woo
15:55 <@bikcmp> lol
16:03 <@dissimulo> heh
16:03 <@dissimulo> sue's up now.
16:04 <@dissimulo> i went to the bathroom
16:04 <@alyx> bikcmp: i think you should make dKingston an oper
16:04 <@dissimulo> to get fresh water for my vapor bong
16:04 <@dissimulo> when i came back, he was all "herp derp hi"
16:04 <@dissimulo> while appearing half-asleep
16:05 <@dissimulo> and said he needs my help to pack
16:05 <@dissimulo> also, alyx, thank you - that reminds me
16:05 <@dissimulo> how do you oper up here, exactly?
16:05 <@dissimulo> i'm used to /oper user pass
16:05 <@alyx> yeah
16:05 <@alyx> that's how you do it
16:05 <@dissimulo> ah
16:06 <@alyx> although it's been so long without an oline, bikcmp might have changed it without me knowing (COUGH COUGH BIKCMP)
16:06 <@dissimulo> bikcmp has said i'd get one, but im still waiting for it
16:06 <@dissimulo> :P
16:06 <@dissimulo> haha
16:06 <@alyx> dissimulo: I've been waiting for the one I used to have for like, 6 months :P
16:06 <@dissimulo> hahaha
16:06 <@dissimulo> this is why i prefer unrealircd
16:06 <@dissimulo> more accountability
16:07 <@alyx> hah :P
16:07 <@dissimulo> but nooooo
16:07 <@dissimulo> bikcmp is married to charybdis
16:08 <@dissimulo> and he chooses now not to talk
16:08  * dissimulo glares pointedly at bikcmp 
16:10 <@alyx> charybdis is nice
16:10 <@dissimulo> that it can be, but as far as i see, it creates unnecessary issues
16:11 <@dissimulo> ...just sayin'
16:11 <@alyx> like what? :P
16:11 <@dissimulo> can't recall the one thing
16:12 <@dissimulo> but it was something bikcmp was trying to do
16:12 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: i'm coding :P
16:12 <@dissimulo> and i said it was so easy to do in unreal
16:12 <@bikcmp> ok
16:12  * dissimulo shrugs
16:12 <@bikcmp> alyx: so
16:12 <@bikcmp> alyx: what are you bitching about now
16:12 <@dissimulo> bikcmp: haha, we're bitching about our missing o:lines ;P
16:12 <@dissimulo> or whatever that is in chary
16:12 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: o:lines
16:12 <@bikcmp> and, i gave you one
16:12 <@bikcmp> lol
16:12 <@dissimulo> you gave me one
16:12 <@bikcmp> yep
