01:12 < Sue|vmh1> openstack is ubuntu

12:28 < `> so we can track issues/bugs
12:28 < `> and contribute code
12:30 < `> doesn't mean it'd be open source, it'd be in-house.
12:33 <@aranjedeath> Sue, http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-08-18/sex-changes-a-constitutional-right-in-brazil/643450
12:34 <@Sue> mmm
12:34 <@aranjedeath> read it
12:34 <@aranjedeath> no really
12:34 <@Sue> said the ruling would prevent self-mutilation by people with sexual identity problems.
12:34 <@aranjedeath> ^
12:34 < `> yeah
12:34 <@aranjedeath> Yeah.
12:34 <@aranjedeath> So uh
12:34 < `> why can't be the U.S. be that "cool"?
12:35 <@aranjedeath> Brazil, anyone?
12:35 < `> OH I KNOW
12:35 <@aranjedeath> I know why
12:35 < `> uptight religiot assholes.
12:35 <@aranjedeath> Nah
12:35 <@Sue> >founded by puritans
12:35 < `> and that.
12:35 <@Sue> anyway
12:36 <@Sue> aranjedeath: do you need anything else from me re: the website?
12:36 <@aranjedeath> We're an individualist consumerist neocorporatist democratic republic
12:36 <@aranjedeath> n.n
12:36 <@aranjedeath> that's why we can't have it
12:36 <@aranjedeath> :>
12:36 <@Sue> i know some of those words
12:36 < `> whatever it is
12:36 <@aranjedeath> Officially the US is actually a neo-corporatist democratic-republic
12:37 <@aranjedeath> We're not `a democracy`
12:37 < `> im just glad CA made it "sorta" legal to do weed
12:37 <@aranjedeath> ancient greeks were `a democracy`
12:37 < `> fuck the DEA, etc
12:37 <@aranjedeath> go look up those words, if you've interest
12:37 <@Sue> i'm around blaine so later
12:37 <@aranjedeath> <-- am political science major
12:37 <@aranjedeath> kay kay
12:38 < `> clearly. :P
12:38 <@aranjedeath> Formerly computer science
12:38 < `> so who's Blaine?
12:38 <@aranjedeath> seriously, fuck OOJAva
12:38 <@aranjedeath> He's a kid zach hangs out with
12:38 <@Sue> teddybear with a giant asshole exterior
12:38 <@aranjedeath> side effect is, zach gets his `old` shit when he doesn't want it
12:38 <@aranjedeath> for varying definitions of old
12:39 <@aranjedeath> haha is he becoming a better person at any rate?
12:39 <@Sue> sorta yeah
12:39 <@aranjedeath> cool cool
12:39 <@aranjedeath> good to hear
12:39 <@Sue> he's just really shell-y
12:39 <@aranjedeath> we know what that's like
12:39 <@aranjedeath> :>
12:39 <@Sue> and he will always be an asshole
12:39 <@Sue> but less
12:40 <@aranjedeath> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism#Neo-corporatism
12:40 <@aranjedeath> It's funny
12:40 <@aranjedeath> conservatives `hate liberalism` in this country
12:40 <@aranjedeath> which is hilarious
12:41 <@aranjedeath> because liberalism is better known as laissez-faire economics
12:41 <@aranjedeath> which is all they ever advocate
12:41 < `> lol
12:41 <@aranjedeath> I just
12:41 <@aranjedeath> I love politics
12:41  * ` wonders if Blaine will be an asshole to my deafness
12:41 <@aranjedeath> It's so fucking /queer/
12:41 <@Sue> `: he's not that kind of asshole
12:42 < `> lol what kind of asshole is he, then?
12:42 <@Sue> politics asshole
12:42 <@aranjedeath> Any chance to cut you down and belittle you, last I interacted with him
12:42 <@Sue> he just doesn't like aranje
12:42 <@Sue> afaik
12:42 <@aranjedeath> haha not surprising
12:42 < `> lol why?
12:42 <@Sue> who knows
12:42  * aranjedeath afks to play LoL with a FRIENDO
12:43 <@Sue> i think he's threatened by aranje being smarter than him with politics
12:43 < `> lmao
12:43 <@Sue> he's that kind of asshole
12:43 < `> haha, who must be smart, etc?
12:43 <@Sue> he has no ability to accept that other people are better than him
12:43 < `> lol.
12:43 <@Sue> he's really smart though
12:44 <@aranjedeath> He's strong in his convictions
12:44 <@Sue> he's going in for physics
12:44 < `> if my math skills were even up to par
12:44 < `> i'd probably actually like physics
12:44 <@Sue> `: he's the exact opposite of us
12:44 < `> but alas
12:44 <@aranjedeath> I failed calc
12:44 <@aranjedeath> wait no
12:44 <@aranjedeath> got a d in calc
12:44 <@Sue> with math
12:45 <@aranjedeath> I don't know trig, as it were
12:45 < `> i dont even know pre-alge
12:45 < `> just so you guise know.
12:45 <@Sue> if i could keep him out of the group, i'd have him as our accountant
12:45 < `> i cant even do division on my own, etc
12:45 <@Sue> hey aranjedeath, how many times did i retake alg?
12:45 < `> 5th grade math, mah boys
12:45 <@Sue> alg 1
12:45 < `> thats where im at
12:45 <@Sue> 3 i think
12:45 < `> ...IF it's even 5th grade math
12:45 <@Sue> don't worry about it
12:46 < `> i was told 5th grade was when public schools were supposed to teach alge1
12:46 <@Sue> `: that's why we have accountants
12:46 < `> i wasnt even taught alge1 till 8th
12:46 < `> 8th grade
12:46 < `> fucking schools.
12:46 < `> }:A
12:47 < `> and even then
12:47 < `> the school transferred me out not wanting to teach me
12:47 < `> before i could actually learn anything
12:47 < `> longstory.jpg
12:47 < `> anyway, where are we at right now with hardnet/hh
12:49 <@Sue> he's playing a game now
12:49 <@Sue> `: goal is now two full host nodes
13:03 < `> sounds good
13:03 < `> im all for it
13:03 < `> i want to fill my simplehosting node
13:03 < `> and requisition another and fill that by midsummer
13:03 < `> if not earlier.
13:05 <@Sue> when the time comes i'll do the nodes for you
13:05 <@Sue> self-managed, basically
13:08 < `> yeah
13:08 < `> i manage the simplehosting nodes
13:08 < `> you manage the big bad stuff
13:08 < `> }:A
13:08 < `> i use directAdmin for the simplehosting CP
13:09 < `> can't help but wonder how bikcmp will be for that purpose
13:09 <@Sue> bik's cp will deal with the vps stuff
13:09 < `> so it's literal VPS CP
13:09 <@Sue> your website is seperate, linked from hardestynetworks
13:09 < `> i know
13:09 < `> just wondering if we could do it all inhouse
13:10 <@Sue> oh
13:10 < `> save on licensing
13:10 <@Sue> nah
13:10 <@Sue> people love control panels
13:10 < `> yeah
13:10 < `> dA it is, then.
13:10 <@Sue> eventually we'll have bik or someone do the webhosting cp
13:10 < `> dA licensing isn't a huge deal atm
13:10 < `> so, it's all good
13:11 <@Sue> `: i need to go over numbers with an accountant, bad
13:11 <@Sue> do you have dropbox?
13:11 < `> have, never use it.
13:11 <@Sue> good
13:11 <@Sue> got excel?
13:12 < `> as in
13:12 < `> i hate dropbox
13:12 <@Sue> spreadsheets
13:12 < `> i have xcel
13:12 <@Sue> i'm gonna do up a spreadsheet
13:12 <@Sue> tonight
13:12 < `> kk
13:12 <@Sue> we need solid numbers
13:12 <@Sue> right now i'm doing it all in my head
13:13 <@Sue> which is hard on my head
13:14 < `> yeah
13:14 < `> put everything down on "paper"
13:15 <@Sue> `: the other reason ubuntu is an ok choice for now is that ksplice supports it
13:17 < `> <3 ksplice on servers
14:37 <@aranjedeath> All I need to say is that oracle owns ksplice
14:37  * aranjedeath goes back to playing games
14:37 <@bikcmp> `: well, it is, yes, but not publicly- atm it's just for bikcmp
14:37 <@bikcmp> in regards to 17:27:53  < `> bikcmp: the CPs that you're writing
14:37 <@bikcmp> 17:28:03  < `> bikcmp: is it versioned? git?
14:37 <@bikcmp> 17:28:15  < `> so we can track issues/bugs
16:01 <@Sue> bikcmp: what he's asking is if we can hack away at it a bit
16:01 <@bikcmp> ah
16:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: tbh there isn't much to hack away at
16:01 <@Sue> make it more pretty
16:01 <@Sue> that's the big issue
16:02 <@bikcmp> for the user?
16:02 <@Sue> also: guess what
16:02 <@bikcmp> Sue: you got laid
16:02 <@Sue> so i'm moving into FiOS territory
16:02 <@bikcmp> sorry to hear

16:02 <@Sue> 300/65
16:02 <@bikcmp> Sue: yes
16:02 <@bikcmp> Sue: but to this day they're trying to sue me

16:05 <@Sue> he's already got a macbook pro and he's getting a new laptop this year
16:06 <@Sue> he hasn't touched this one in almost 8 months
16:17 <@bikcmp> hmm
16:17 <@bikcmp> Sue: know what might be cool
16:17 <@bikcmp> Sue: 'trials'.
17:27 <@aranjedeath> Sue, where did vatn go?
17:27 <@aranjedeath> Did we piss someone off and the machine got removed? :/
17:43 < `> bikcmp: why are you being sued by verizon?
17:45 < `> and i love verizon
17:45 < `> have had NO issues with them
17:45 < `> even years ago when they first deployed ADSL up in the mountains.
17:46 < `> i need to actually enable some things
17:46 < `> by changing up my infra
17:46 < `> Sue: i wouldnt mind going 100mbit if you can help with the $

18:00 <@aranjedeath> fucking P!nk, mang
18:00 <@aranjedeath> Her music video for "Raise Your Glass"
18:00 <@aranjedeath> I'm speechless that a mainstream artist was allowed to put some of that in a video
18:02 <@aranjedeath> and the entire video is a tribute to nerds
18:02 <@aranjedeath> so win
18:30 <@aranjedeath> I see what you're talking about fios being 300mbit http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/05/faster-than-your-router-verizon-doubles-fios-speeds-to-300mbps/
18:44 <@bikcmp> `: they  gave me problems.
18:44 <@bikcmp> like
18:44 <@bikcmp> as in, hmm
18:44 <@bikcmp> they say i owe them money
18:44 <@bikcmp> i don't
18:44 <@bikcmp> sorry

18:50 <@aranjedeath> What is `lagging`?
18:50 <@aranjedeath> I've never experienced this before
18:53 <@aranjedeath> mmm
18:54  * aranjedeath blasts music
21:05 < `> bikcmp: i owe verizon money and i'm still using fios
21:05 < `> }:A
21:05 < `> i'm evil like that.
21:06 < `> no not really, i have friends at verizon that helps me break it down really small and add to my bill
21:06 < `> which helps.
21:06 <@aranjedeath> amortize your costs!
21:07 <@aranjedeath> mmm, accounting

08:45 < Joey> Sue, where would I install PHP on my server? It doesn't look like it's there yet.
11:07 <@bikcmp> Joey: apt-get install php5
11:08 < Joey> yeah, but where
11:08 <@bikcmp> Joey: uh
11:08 <@bikcmp> Joey: it'll do it for you.

11:09 <@bikcmp> you should really get that.
11:09 <@bikcmp> (that's actually a really good book, from what i hear)

11:17 <@`> x.x
11:18 <@`> yeah
11:33 <@bikcmp> lol
11:33 <@bikcmp> `: i'm thinking about making a (seperate, though) project for irondust
11:33 <@bikcmp> like, twitter and g+ combined
11:33 <@bikcmp> the ideas of em
11:41 <@Sue> `: are you still planning on coming up the last few days i'm here?
11:42 <@Sue> bikcmp: php is already installed on joey's server
11:42 <@Sue> for all intents and purposes it's set up, but i need to dump the nginx config template on to the server
11:43 <@Sue> but i don't have access to the library at the moment because i'm gone
11:47 <@bikcmp> Sue: ok
11:47 <@bikcmp> Sue: here still
11:48 <@bikcmp> `/8
11:48 <@bikcmp> hmm
11:50 <@Sue> bikcmp: do you understand why i haven't done anything the past few days?
11:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: not at all
11:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: busy?
11:51 <@Sue> i'm moving so every family member around me is like YOU HAVE TO COME HANG OUT
11:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: ah
11:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: did you get a chance to grab the card?
11:51 <@Sue> and i have no car so they have me hostage
11:51 <@Sue> no, and nobody has paid that was supposed to yet
11:52 <@Sue> if i pay you now, the ledger will be absolute 0
11:52 <@Sue> we only have 50 bucks left

11:53 <@Sue> this netbook and beer
11:53 <@Sue> and my mother trying to get me to not move
11:53 <@Sue> productivity is at an absolute standstill
11:54 <@bikcmp> lol
11:54 <@bikcmp> Sue: my parents would be like
11:54 <@bikcmp> get out
11:54 <@Sue> i haven't lived with either of my parents (they're divorced) in almost three years
11:55 <@bikcmp> lol
11:55 <@Sue> and now i'm moving 300 miles away so they're both like OH GOD OUR SON
11:55 <@Sue> if i could work on all this i could, but i'm basically stuck on emergency internet access

11:56 <@Sue> and att internet

12:18 <@`> etc
12:18 <@`> in other words, i have way too much laying around

12:07 <@bikcmp> lol
12:08 <@bikcmp> Shadow: i have no idea how to do php with ngnix
12:08 <@bikcmp> i'd use lighttpd
12:45 < aranjedeath> what's tether
12:45 <@bikcmp> for real?
12:45 <@bikcmp> as in
12:45 <@bikcmp> use your phone
12:45 < aranjedeath> to do what
12:46 <@bikcmp> access the internet
12:46 < aranjedeath> over edge?
12:46 <@bikcmp> sure
12:46 < aranjedeath> I don't know how I'd do that
12:47 <@bikcmp> hm
12:50 < aranjedeath> my phone doesn't usb
12:50 < aranjedeath> and edge is slower than dialup
12:50 <@bikcmp> what phone
12:50 <@bikcmp> lol
12:50 < aranjedeath> samsung magnet
12:50 <@bikcmp> lol
12:50 < aranjedeath> n.n
12:50 < aranjedeath> I don't have a smartphone.
12:51 <@bikcmp> loser

12:56 <@bikcmp> Sue: where is my moolah
12:56 <@Sue> still haven't been paid
12:56 <@bikcmp> Sue: and when do you expect to get paid
12:56 <@Sue> as of now? four days ago
12:56 < aranjedeath> Sue, here lemme just copy it since it's the 4 lines before I said your services are requested
12:56 < aranjedeath> <Shadow> erm
12:56 < aranjedeath> <Shadow> is anyone here
12:56 < aranjedeath> <Shadow> PHP still isn't working on my servdrt
12:56 < aranjedeath> <Shadow> *server
12:56 <@Sue> oh
12:57 <@bikcmp> Sue: see pm too
12:57 <@Sue> i need to obliterate his server, use my good root password, and install and do everything for him and not have you guys give him root
12:57 <@bikcmp> Sue: why
12:57 <@bikcmp> Sue: he wants to do some stuff on his own
12:57 < aranjedeath> I figured linking to a guide would be enough n.n
12:58 <@Sue> because if he touches anything i've already done it'll void his managementship
12:58 <@bikcmp> uh
12:58 <@bikcmp> he's touched a /lot/
12:58 <@bikcmp> lol
12:58 <@bikcmp> Sue: anyway. i'm not that happy that the supposed payment is 4 days behind
12:58 <@Sue> bikcmp: the feeling is mutual
12:59 <@bikcmp> Sue: when do you expect to have money
12:59 <@bikcmp> like
12:59 <@Sue> soon
12:59 <@bikcmp> i have no idea how you allow these people to keep not paying you
12:59 <@bikcmp> i'm obviously not going to do any more work until i get some of the money
13:00 < aranjedeath> contracts mothafuckaaaaaa
13:00 <@Sue> so how am i going about this for now
13:00 <@Sue> >free vps worth 20 dollars
13:00 <@bikcmp> yeah
13:00 <@bikcmp> Sue: i understand that
13:00 <@Sue> >starting company that's running under right now
13:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: but you need to collect money from people
13:01 <@Sue> >only way to get money is to keep working
13:01 <@Sue> i will collect
13:01 <@Sue> today even
13:01 <@bikcmp> it's not so much that i want it
13:01 <@bikcmp> i'd settle for less, i don't care
13:01 <@bikcmp> you're a nice enough person
13:01 <@Sue> thank you
13:01 <@Sue> but i need to collect, i understand
13:01 <@bikcmp> it's just the fact that you seem to be letting people go behind on the payments
13:01 <@bikcmp> yeah
13:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: that's kinda what's making me worry
13:02 <@Sue> i need a person dedicated to dealing with payments
13:03 <@Sue> hey aranjedeath, how many assholes have i let host on me for free?
13:03 <@Sue> remember otakucomplex?
13:03 < Shadow> Sue, hi.
13:03 <@Sue> >placing sue in charge of asking for money
13:03 <@Sue> hi Shadow 
13:03 <@Sue> we're in a bind right now
13:03 < Shadow> i'm not surprised :P
13:04 < Shadow> anyway, when you have time, i don't think PHP is installed on my server
13:04 <@Sue> well, i could fix that
13:04 <@Sue> but do you have any money for your server yet?
13:05 < Shadow> yeah, i've had money, it's just working out a time to pay it
13:05 < Shadow> and i think that time is this evening
13:05 < Shadow> because i'm literally about to walk out the door
13:05 <@Sue> good
13:05 <@Sue> if you pay, i'll take over what bik was doing and show you how to use debian
13:06 < Shadow> sounds good
13:06 <@Sue> well, ubuntu, because we need a little easier to work with os
13:06 <@bikcmp> Sue: please do
13:06 <@bikcmp> lol
13:06 <@bikcmp> eh
13:06 < Shadow> also, do you have any problem with me paying a year in advance
13:06 <@bikcmp> ubuntu's more bloat
13:06 <@Sue> Shadow: no
13:06 <@Sue> bikcmp: but it's easier
13:06 <@Sue> trust me on this
13:06 < Shadow> i don't really mind what os is used as long as it's not windows
13:06 <@Sue> yup
13:09 < Shadow> Sue, fwiw, my network is currently running
13:09 < Shadow> at 108.170.18.148
13:10 <@Sue> thanks
13:10 < Shadow> do you plan to redo that too?
13:10 <@Sue> no
13:10 <@Sue> you'll keep your ip
13:10 < Shadow> er, no
13:10 <@Sue> Shadow: what have you done on the box so far
13:10 < Shadow> i meant do you plan to redo charybdis/atheme installations
13:11 <@Sue> well...
13:11 < Shadow> Sue: bik installed chary and i installed atheme
13:11 < Shadow> if you do, it's no problem
13:11 <@Sue> yeah
13:11 <@Sue> debian 6 is getting horrendously old
13:11 < Shadow> i also tried installing php and lighttpd
13:11 < Shadow> to no avail
13:11 <@Sue> you already have php and nginx installed
13:12 < Shadow> i know i have nginx, but i keep encountering problems when dealing with php
13:12 < Shadow> problems as in it doesn't look like it's installed
13:12 <@Sue> that's why i said i'd backup, obliterate, and redo, but let you watch as i do it
13:12 < Shadow> okay
13:12 <@Sue> and i'll take it slow
13:12 < Shadow> alright, sounds good
13:12 < Shadow> i have to leave now for a little while
13:12 < Shadow> be back some time in the next few hours
13:12 <@Sue> alright
13:14 <@Sue> bikcmp: >collection also >hardesty way
16:41 < Shadow> Sue, here?
16:41 <@bikcmp> Shadow: ?
16:42 < Shadow> I wanted to know if/when he was going to redo my entire vps
16:42 <@bikcmp> i doubt it
16:42 <@bikcmp> i think he was being sarcastic
16:42 <@bikcmp> i'd say it's pretty silly to redo it
16:43 < Shadow> <@Sue> i need to obliterate his server, use my good root password, and install and do everything for him and not have you guys give him root
16:44 <@bikcmp> Shadow: wait until he sobers up
16:44 <@bikcmp> `: how will you live with this bitch
16:44 <@bikcmp> god
16:44 < Shadow> lol
16:48 <@Sue> yeah i'm here
16:48 <@Sue> i'm not even drunk
16:48 <@Sue> that was a two day binge at my mother's house
16:48 <@bikcmp> oh
16:48 <@Sue> it's the only way i can deal with not being around my desktop
16:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: ...addict.
16:49 <@Sue> <3
16:49 <@bikcmp> though 
16:49 <@bikcmp> i'm bikcmp
16:49 <@bikcmp> so like
16:49 <@bikcmp> yeah
16:49 <@Sue> now, i'm serious about the redoing his server
16:49 <@Sue> god knows what you two've done to it
16:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: i think that's silly
16:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: nothing at all
16:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: i haven't even logged in on it
16:49 <@bikcmp> lol
16:49 <@bikcmp> i threw him a configuration file for ircd.conf
16:49 <@bikcmp> that's it
16:49 <@Sue> oh
16:49 <@bikcmp> that's why i'm like, wth
16:49 <@Sue> ok
16:50 <@bikcmp> Sue: basically
16:50 <@Sue> i'm still going to build a template
16:50 <@Sue> and deploy that instead
16:50 <@bikcmp> a while ago in #sml joey was talking about making his own network or smth
16:50 <@bikcmp> he asked me for help
16:50 <@bikcmp> or somehow it came up
16:50 <@bikcmp> and i told him that i'd seriously advise using an existing network, even if not this one
16:50 <@bikcmp> but i'd help him but not hold his hand
16:51 <@bikcmp> i felt bad since he just bought a server, so i set up the ircd and then essentially said 'you're on your own'
16:51 <@bikcmp> but jesus christ
16:51 <@bikcmp> lol
16:51 <@bikcmp> if i didn't do the ircd.conf god knows where he'd be at
16:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: do you know of any good gnu/linux books for him
16:51 <@bikcmp> the ones i saw were 12 years old
16:51 < Shadow> everything that i put on the server that didn't work i deleted
16:52 <@bikcmp> Shadow: how did you delete it
16:52 < Shadow> by pressing the delete button
16:52 < Shadow> (winscp)
16:52 <@bikcmp> ..delete but?
16:52 <@bikcmp> oh
16:56 <@Sue> no, i'm gonna do what i do best
16:56 <@Sue> teach
16:57 <@Sue> ... after i roll a template so i don't have to apt-get install nginx 4000 times
16:59 < Shadow> could you teach me how to make php work
16:59 < Shadow> lol
16:59 <@Sue> yes
16:59 <@bikcmp> Shadow: for fuck's sake
16:59 <@Sue> it's actually really easy my way
16:59 <@Sue> shh bikcmp 
16:59 <@bikcmp> Shadow: lmgtfy.com/?q=nginx+php+debian+6
16:59 <@Sue> NO
16:59 <@Sue> BAD
16:59  * Shadow grabs popcorn
16:59 <@bikcmp> Sue: he needs to learn to fend for himself
16:59 <@bikcmp> seriously
16:59 <@bikcmp> it just use fastcgi
17:00 <@Sue> this is like the one or two times google tells you the wrong thing
17:00 <@bikcmp> Sue: i'll happily bet it'll work
17:00 < Shadow> bikcmp, except i wanted a managed vps
17:00 <@bikcmp> Shadow: oh
17:00 <@bikcmp> Shadow: it was managed?
17:00 <@bikcmp> in that case never mind
17:00  * Shadow quietly nudges CaptainTrek
17:00 <@Sue> 99% of articles on google say to use nginx like it's 2009
17:01 <@Sue> 80% of them say to use if statements
17:01 < Shadow> bikcmp, sure, i'd love to learn how to use linux operating systems but it's not my top priority
17:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: ok then 
17:01 <@Sue> bikcmp: http://wiki.nginx.org/IfIsEvil
17:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: i use other httpds
17:02 <@Sue> Shadow: i still won't be able to set up charybdis though
17:02 <@Sue> that's up to you
17:02 < Shadow> it's already ste up
17:02 < Shadow> *set
17:02 < Shadow> thanks to bik
17:02 <@Sue> then i won't reroll you for now
17:02 <@bikcmp> Sue: i did the ircd config 
17:02 < Shadow> okay, then i'll resume modifying stuff
17:02 <@Sue> i'll just hope you didn't muck with /etc
17:02 <@bikcmp> i told him for atheme he's on his own
17:03 <@bikcmp> Sue: he originally set it up as /root/
17:03 <@bikcmp> and i caught that and i was like
17:03 <@bikcmp> wtf
17:03 <@bikcmp> lol
17:03 < Shadow> bbl
17:03 <@Sue> ok
17:03 <@Sue> Shadow: the biggest thing is that if you want me to work on it, being strapped for cash i would like some sort of payment first
17:04 <@Sue> i was fine earlier then people started to not pay me
17:04  * bikcmp claps
17:04 <@Sue> shh
17:04 <@Sue> i can request payment
17:04 <@bikcmp> Sue: i don't know.  like i've said a couple times though, i think that joey should seriously consider just using an existing network
17:04 <@bikcmp> but it's his vps
17:04 <@bikcmp> i didn't realize it was managed
17:04 <@Sue> that's why he didn't have the root password
17:05 <@bikcmp> Sue: eh
17:05 <@Sue> that's why i was a little miffed about you resetting it
17:05 <@bikcmp> Sue: i'd give him the root pw either way
17:05 <@Sue> no
17:05 <@bikcmp> you know?
17:05 <@bikcmp> it's his vps anyway
17:05 <@Sue> managed means no root
17:05 <@bikcmp> k then
17:05 <@Sue> how about this
17:05 <@bikcmp> Sue: what i'd do is just use ssh keys for all of us
17:05 <@bikcmp> so there's a 'team' of people adminning
17:05 <@Sue> yeah
17:05 <@bikcmp> http://171.25.159.60/bikcmp/ssh_key.txt
17:05 <@bikcmp> oh
17:05 <@bikcmp> no
17:05 <@bikcmp> that ip's way gone
17:05 <@bikcmp> lol
17:06 <@Sue> what i'll do is do it for him then remove all warranty by giving him root
17:06 <@Sue> how about that
17:06 <@bikcmp> warrenty?
17:06 <@Sue> i'll set it up but it won't be managed
17:06 <@bikcmp> Sue: you do realize there's also semi-managed
17:06 <@bikcmp> yeah?
17:06 <@bikcmp> lol
17:06 <@Sue> semi-managed is quick tips and stuff
17:06 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:06 <@bikcmp> Sue: which is what i intended to do with him
17:06 <@bikcmp> i didn't expect to do this much
17:07 <@bikcmp> and i thought i was doing a favor
17:08 <@Sue> we are a terrible company
17:08 <@Sue> :D
17:10 <@Sue> but we can improve as time goes on
17:49 < Shadow> what's the benefit of having root
17:50 < Shadow> also, Sue, i will pay you tonight
19:05 < aranjedeath> I'm so not even going to read up
19:05 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: don't
19:05 < aranjedeath> I have LoL to play
19:07 <@bikcmp> LoL?
19:07 < aranjedeath> league of legends
19:07 < aranjedeath> on ubuntu the benefit of having root is minimal
19:07 < aranjedeath> just get added to sudoers file
19:41 -!- iNsAn|tY [~insanity@2a01:4f8:121:gzq::tpmo:zspn] has joined #hh
20:08 < iNsAn|tY> hello...

20:36 <@bikcmp> sue is never around
21:12 <@Sue> yeah
21:14 <@bikcmp> iNsAn|tY: 
21:14 < Shadow> bikcmp, i have an occasional question
21:14 <@bikcmp> oh god.
21:14 <@bikcmp> Shadow: sup
21:14 < Shadow> actually never mind
21:15 <@bikcmp> no, really
21:15 < Shadow> i might later
21:15 < Shadow> no, i figured i'd just try ity
21:15 < Shadow> *it
21:15 <@Sue> Shadow: i'm sorry there's so much in-fighting surrounding your vps
21:15 < Shadow> Sue, it's no problem
21:16 < Shadow> bikcmp, actually i have a different question
21:16 <@bikcmp> ffs what is it
21:16 <@bikcmp> lol
21:16 < Shadow> is python-twisted installed on my server
21:16 <@Sue> Shadow: what was your ip
21:16 < Shadow> 108.170.18.148
21:17 <@Sue> oh right i don't have an account on that box
21:17 <@Sue> one sec
21:17 <@Sue> now i do
21:17 < Shadow> i gotta go to the bathroom
21:17 < Shadow> one sec
21:17 < Shadow> okay, done
21:17 <@Sue> lol
21:18 <@bikcmp> .../
21:18 <@bikcmp> lo
21:18 <@bikcmp> l
21:20 <@Sue> Shadow: no, it's not installed
21:20 < Shadow> okay
21:20 < Shadow> i'll do it
21:20 <@Sue> wait
21:20 <@Sue> can i teach you a little
21:20 < Shadow> okay i probably shouldn't do it
21:20 < Shadow> sure
21:20 <@Sue> do dpkg -s python-twisted
21:20 <@bikcmp> apt-get install python-twisted you silly
21:20 <@Sue> wait bik
21:21 < Shadow> python python-twisted python-twisted-bin python-twisted-core python-twisted-runner python-twisted-names python-twisted-mail python-twisted-words python-twisted-web python-zope.interface python-openssl openjdk-6 mercurial
21:21 < Shadow> i need those too
21:21 <@bikcmp> wtf
21:21 <@Sue> *sigh*
21:21 <@bikcmp> Shadow: apt-get install python-twisted
21:21 <@bikcmp> lol
21:21 <@Sue> nevermind
21:21 <@Sue> if you're not going to wait and listen i'm not going to help
21:21 < Shadow> i'm right here
21:22 < Shadow> i've been listening
21:22 <@bikcmp> just apt-get them :/
21:22 <@Sue> bikcmp: shut up
21:22 <@bikcmp> lol
21:22 < Shadow> Sue, i haven't done anything yet
21:22 <@Sue> ok
21:22 <@Sue> sorry
21:22 <@Sue> i just woke up
21:22 <@Sue> dpkg -s <package name> shows if a package is installed instantly, no waiting for apt
21:22 < Shadow> ok
21:22 <@Sue> it's more proper, too
21:22 <@Sue> but it says:
21:23 <@Sue> Package `python-twisted' is not installed and no info is available.
21:23 <@Sue> so then apt-get install it
21:23 <@Sue> and yes twisted is a gigantic library
21:23 <@Sue> why it wants to install openjdk-6 and mercurial is beyond me
21:25 < Shadow> what about python-zope
21:26 <@Sue> i should teach you aptitude
21:27 <@Sue> what are you installing this for?
21:27 < Shadow> qwebirc
21:27 <@Sue> are you trying to run this in a web server?
21:28 < Shadow> uh
21:28 < Shadow> should i be? lol
21:31 <@Sue> isn't qwebirc a webapp?
21:32 <@Sue> oh no
21:32 <@Sue> hold on
21:33 <@Sue> this is why "the hardesty way" will be the death of me
21:33 <@Sue> i get too involved
21:33 <@Sue> Shadow: that package list is bad news
21:33 <@Sue> it doesn't even name them right
21:33 < Shadow> <Vandarx> ohman
21:33 < Shadow> what did i do now
21:34 <@Sue> hold on a sec, ok? i'll install the dependancies for you
21:34 < Shadow> alright
21:41 <@Sue> Shadow: ok, now follow the rest of the install steps
21:41 <@Sue> later i'll show you why i keep saying nginx
21:44 < Shadow> how do i kill the currently running twistd server
21:45 <@Sue> on linux, "ps ax" shows you what processes are running
21:45 <@Sue> to make this quick and simple, just do "ps x"
21:45 <@Sue> it limits to your account only
21:45 <@Sue> see the one python process?
21:46 < Shadow> yeah
21:46 <@Sue> see the number at the beginning?
21:46 < Shadow> yeah
21:46 <@Sue> 10785
21:46 <@Sue> do "kill 10785"
21:46 < Shadow> bash: kill: (10785) - No such process
21:47 <@Sue> well now it's stopped, weird
21:47 <@Sue> anyway
21:47 <@Sue> you really need to stop running stuff as root
21:47 < Shadow> it's the only way i can run stuff
21:47 <@Sue> why
21:47 < Shadow> running it as the normal user gives me permission denied
21:48 <@Sue> what do you mean
21:48 <@Sue> running what as normal user
21:48 < Shadow> ./run.py
21:48 < Shadow> when running it as a normal user i get permission denied
21:48 < Shadow> so i run it as root
21:48 < Shadow> and it works
21:51 <@Sue> that confuzzles me on so many levels
21:51 <@Sue> i'm trying to find why you're getting that error
21:51 <@Sue> you should *never run anything* as root
21:51 < Shadow> yeah, i even checked the permissions on it and it said that "ircd" has full rights to it
21:52 < Shadow> yet i can't run it as ircd
21:52 < Shadow> also, why should i never run anything as root?
21:52 < Shadow> like, i'm just curious
21:53 <@Sue> the short answer is usually a trip to google for http://cboard.cprogramming.com/tech-board/123049-why-running-programs-root-so-bad.html
21:54 <@Sue> long answer is would you rather have a vicious rabies-ridden dog on a chain outside your house or inside with no chain
21:54 < Shadow> yeah, okay
21:54 <@Sue> inside is running programs as root
21:54 < Shadow> lol
21:55 <@Sue> Shadow: what directory were you running it from when you gave ircd right
21:55 <@Sue> *rights
21:56 < Shadow> i didn't give ircd any rights to it
21:56 < Shadow> i just looked at the rights
21:56 < Shadow> and it already had them
21:56 <@Sue> what directory did you put it in
21:56 < Shadow> /home/ircd/qwebirc is where everything is
21:58 <@Sue> i got no such permission error
21:58 <@Sue> and it's running
21:58 < Shadow> i tried to run it in winscp, that could potentially be the problem
21:58 <@Sue> http://108.170.18.148:9090/
21:58 <@Sue> well, i did come across two problems
21:59 <@Sue> i did actually get that error and it was because you ran it as root
21:59 <@Sue> it left a log file with permissions set to root only
21:59 <@Sue> and it complained about deprecieted libraries
21:59 < Shadow> huh
21:59 <@Sue> the first was solved by deleting the root permissioned log
22:00 <@Sue> the second you can ignore because the website tells you to ignore those errors
22:00 < Shadow> well, thank you for doing that
22:00 < Shadow> i have to leave now, goodnight
22:00 <@Sue> wait
22:00 <@Sue> Shadow: 
22:00 <@Sue> money?
22:00 < Shadow> ah
22:00 < Shadow> f
22:01 <@Sue> paypal to zachary@hardestyhosting.com
22:01 < Shadow> i hate to do this but could i do it tomorrow?
22:01 <@Sue> please make sure you pay in the morning
22:01 <@Sue> or bikcmp will wring my neck
22:01 < Shadow> ok
22:01 < Shadow> goodnight
22:01 -!- Shadow [~Joey@sml/staff/Joey] has quit [Quit: i liek havng fun to, you can call me mr. giggless i like to laf]
22:02 <@Sue> hnnnnng
22:03 < iNsAn|tY> i wouldnt be afraid of bikcmp
22:04 < iNsAn|tY> u have subscriptions set up for paypal autopay?
22:04 <@Sue> i can set that up i think
22:04 <@Sue> i remember you from #devphone
22:04 < iNsAn|tY> this one vps i have uses that... takes the brainwork out of remembering to pay
22:04 < iNsAn|tY> and as much as i get hit in the head, thats helpful
22:05 < iNsAn|tY> so how do i get a vps lit up? and you have a web control panel or anything?
22:07 <@Sue> iNsAn|tY: bikcmp is writing our control panel
22:08 <@Sue> right now it's all manual payments but once he gets that set up we can do subscriptions and more
22:08 <@Sue> i can belt one out right now for you to try but we're really strapped so i can only let you fool with it for a little bit
22:09 <@Sue> i can also let you install the OS yourself if you desire
22:16 < iNsAn|tY> what flavors do u have to choose from?
22:17 <@Sue> whatever you request
22:21 < iNsAn|tY> hmm...
22:47 < iNsAn|tY> sorry.. am back...
22:47 < iNsAn|tY> wonder whats leaner... guess ubuntu...
22:56 <@Sue> i can do that
22:56 <@Sue> what price were you looking at
22:58 < iNsAn|tY> cheap! im a cheap fuck... but ill pay for 2 months up front if itll help... by then maybe youll have an autopay thing setup
22:58 < iNsAn|tY> just a wee little vps to futz around with
23:01 < iNsAn|tY> what can i get for $6.66 a month?
23:02 <@Sue> hah
23:02 <@Sue> it's 5 bucks for 256mb of ram and i think it was 20gb of hard drive space
23:03 < iNsAn|tY> sounds good
23:04 < iNsAn|tY> back in a few
23:07 < aranjedeath> Sue: My website says 8gb of storage on the shit-cheap plan, should I change that?
23:09 < aranjedeath> and Sue: can you get the billing system running or are we doing something different?
23:09 < aranjedeath> If we're doing something different can billing. either not exist or point to the correct place?
23:16 <@Sue> billing is supposed to be in-house
23:16 <@Sue> but we can go through a shopping cart
23:16 <@Sue> i'm about to drop paypal permanently
23:16 <@Sue> i just got notified that my personal account (for no reason) has a 21 day hold on all transactions
23:16  * aranjedeath laughs
23:17 < aranjedeath> that's paypal, man.
23:17 < aranjedeath> It's why everyone hates it
23:17 <@Sue> chase was like 'come to us, we won't do that
23:17 <@Sue> '
23:17 < aranjedeath> yeah okay
23:17  * aranjedeath mumbles something about dwolla
23:17 <@Sue> we can still offer dwolla
23:17 < aranjedeath> It's shit easy to do
23:17 <@Sue> but i'm thinking dwolla plus chase paymentech
23:17 < aranjedeath> It'd take /me/ 10 minutes to integrate that shit
23:18 <@Sue> dwolla google wallet and paymentech
23:18  * aranjedeath nods
23:18 < aranjedeath> My two I like (based on tech for the former and size for the latter) are dwolla and amazon shit
23:18 < aranjedeath> but amazon's not cheap
23:19 < aranjedeath> their shit is... round about paypal, which is fucking high
23:19 < aranjedeath> for a zero value-added service
23:19 < aranjedeath> or almost zero, anyway
23:20 <@Sue> well, paymentech will let us charge over the phone and shit as well
23:20 <@Sue> it's a real merchant service provider
23:21 < aranjedeath> oh cool
23:21 <@Sue> http://www.chasepaymentech.com/
23:21 < aranjedeath> what's the catch?
23:21 < aranjedeath> there's always a catch
23:21 <@Sue> it's 10$ monthly and 2.2% rate
23:22 < aranjedeath> start with gwallet and shit then
23:22 < aranjedeath> cause that's pro, but also expensive for the level we're at right now
23:22 <@Sue> http://www.chasepaymentech.com/credit_card_processing_fees.html
23:22 <@Sue> yeah
23:22 < aranjedeath> once we get 2 servers full, it'll be worth it
23:22 <@Sue> as long as we aren't using paypa
23:22 <@Sue> l
23:22 <@Sue> i'm done with that fucking company
23:22 < aranjedeath> I will not ever suggest paypal
23:22 < aranjedeath> I will even suggest alertpay over them
23:27 < aranjedeath> I love these people http://blog.crysys.hu/2012/06/stuxnet-duqu-flame-open-source-license-questions-v0/
23:27 <@Sue> we might go with http://www.3dcart.com
23:27 <@Sue> it doesn't support dwolla but it does support google and amazon
23:27 < aranjedeath> so why not whatever we've got already?
23:27 < aranjedeath> billing.hh
23:28 < aranjedeath> You still haven't given me a convincing reason why it actually sucks enough to not be on t
23:28 <@Sue> billing.hh doesn't support paymentech
23:29 < aranjedeath> It's business. Untill you're rolling in R&D money, you don't have enough time or money or manpower to be super picky. It really needs to just sort of work.
23:29 <@Sue> that's why i'm going with already works
23:29 <@Sue> 3dcart is a hosted cart that supports google and amazon out of the box
23:29 < aranjedeath> supports paymentech?
23:30 <@Sue> yes
23:30 <@Sue> http://www.3dcart.com/ecommerce-payment-gateways.html
23:30 <@Sue> http://www.3dcart.com/payment-gateways/paymentech-shopping-cart.htm
23:31 < aranjedeath> ahahahaha securitymetrics is their pci compliance verifier
23:31 <@Sue> is that bad?
23:31 < aranjedeath> How secure is a nesus scan
23:31 < aranjedeath> It's fine, either way, it's on their head if they're breached, not us
23:31 <@Sue> yeah
23:32 < aranjedeath> and really I'd rather you just pick one
23:32 <@Sue> so do i have the go ahead?
23:32 < aranjedeath> just fucking do it n.n
23:32 <@Sue> ok
23:32 < aranjedeath> So I don't really want to put your phone number and email on the web
23:33 < aranjedeath> I'm not sure how to do it in a reasonably un-spammy way
23:33 < aranjedeath> :/
23:33 < aranjedeath> http://explodie.org/test/contact.html needs help, and where is login button going to point to?
23:33 <@Sue> aranjedeath: i can blacklist phone numbers on my phone
23:33 <@Sue> so no worried
23:33 <@Sue> *s
23:33 < aranjedeath> If you're comfortable with that
23:33 <@Sue> it's the hardesty way
23:34 < aranjedeath> still 5285?
23:34 <@Sue> oh, use that quote
23:34 <@Sue> yeah

00:01 < aranjedeath> do you still want /sysinfo/?
00:04 < aranjedeath> Sue, ^
00:11 <@Sue> at some point no
00:11 <@Sue> oops
00:11 <@Sue> i meant just no
00:11 <@Sue> stupid buffer
00:31 <@Sue> damn
00:31 <@Sue> we might go with whmcs + a payment gateway module
00:55 <@Sue> aranjedeath: i figured how i want the logo
00:57 <@Sue> aranjedeath: http://hardestyhosting.com/mirror/logoidea.jpg
01:04 < aranjedeath> lol ardesty hosting

01:07 < aranjedeath> got bigger problems than branding (bootstrap, done!)
01:25 <@Sue> i dunno son
01:25 <@Sue> aranjedeath: whmcs + authorize.net through paymentech
01:25 <@Sue> whmcs has a dwolla module
01:25 < aranjedeath> that's a lot of letters that means nothing

16:54 <@bikcmp> like, hm
16:55 < Sue|phone> I'm not in the position to talk about this now
16:55 <@bikcmp> [X] IRC authentation - 6/5/2012 11:10p to 11:30p

18:58 < aranjedeath> sorry if it effects anyone's shit n.n
18:58  * bikcmp lags.
18:58 <@bikcmp> lol
18:59 < aranjedeath> lol
18:59 < aranjedeath> 126kbps, not bad
18:59 < aranjedeath> gonna take a while though
18:59 < aranjedeath> lol
19:00 < aranjedeath> Hey so on the new box
19:00 < aranjedeath> wherever that is, with all the bandwidth and things
19:00 < aranjedeath> is there a chance to set up a small vps? Say... 64m ram, running freebsd?
19:01  * aranjedeath wants to put in a /real/ cdn.hardestyhosting or cdn.hardestynetworks 
19:01 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i'm the guy to do that
19:01 <@bikcmp> irc.irondust.net is an alias for irc.g.irondust.net.
19:01 <@bikcmp> irc.g.irondust.net has address 178.79.153.80
19:01 <@bikcmp> irc.g.irondust.net has IPv6 address 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe93:91d3
19:01 <@bikcmp> just saying
19:01 <@bikcmp> lol
19:02 < aranjedeath> What are you saying, exactly?
19:02 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: as in, i'd be the one to do the cdn
19:02 < Shadow> bikcmp, i got my domain
19:02 <@bikcmp> yay
19:02 < Shadow> for future reference how do i make the user connect to irc.stardustfields.net
19:02 <@bikcmp> uh.
19:02 <@bikcmp> /connect irc.stardustields.net
19:02 <@bikcmp> lol
19:03 < Shadow> no like
19:03 < Shadow> make them have to connect to that
19:03 < Shadow> and stardustfields.net wouldn't work
19:03 < Shadow> er
19:03 < Shadow> wait
19:03 <@bikcmp> nope
19:03 <@bikcmp> lol
19:03 < aranjedeath> Okay. I've had a /mirror/ directory on my site for years (which is why all of our sites have a mirror dir, zach liked the idea)
19:03 < Shadow> so the subdomain doesn't matter when doing anything, does it
19:03 <@bikcmp> it does
19:03 < aranjedeath> figured someday we can have a proper cdn with a bit of geolocation or sommat
19:03 < Shadow> how?
19:03 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: yes
19:04 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: like i said, i'm the person to do that.
19:04 <@bikcmp> lol
19:04 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i could make a cdn, assuming that /all servers have the same content/
19:04 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: if you want that, i can have something set up VERY fast.
19:04 <@bikcmp> like, 30 mins.
19:04 <@bikcmp> assuming you have the info i want
19:04 <@bikcmp> i already have the code.
19:05 < aranjedeath> Heh, neat. My simple idea was to have a master server with the stuff in it, and every10minute cronjobs would rsync the node servers
19:05 < aranjedeath> heh
19:05 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: do you have the server addresses?
19:05 <@bikcmp> and is the supposed cdn content set up yet?
19:05 <@bikcmp> if so, i could actually get a cdn working in a few mins.
19:05 < aranjedeath> Not really :)
19:05 <@bikcmp> lol
19:05 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: want me to set it up so when the time comes?
19:05 <@bikcmp> that's an awesome project
19:05 <@bikcmp> lol
19:05 < aranjedeath> Yes.
19:05 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: ok
19:05 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i need the addresses and ips of the servers.
19:05 <@bikcmp> pm em
19:06 < aranjedeath> yup, I know :)
19:06 < aranjedeath> For now I've got mirror.explodie.org but that's on nagisa.
19:06 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: pm me the servers involved ;
19:07 < aranjedeath> I don't have multiple servers yet
19:07 <@bikcmp> fag
19:07 <@bikcmp> :(
19:07 < aranjedeath> That's why it's a future thing
19:07 <@bikcmp> lol
19:07 < aranjedeath> haha
19:07 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: when you want to do it, tell me, and i'll literally have it up in an hour
19:07 < aranjedeath> If I had multiple servers, I'd have it running already :P
19:07 <@bikcmp> geo and all ;p
19:07 < aranjedeath> yeah geo's the only thing I haven't worked out yet
19:07 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i already have the solution /right here/
19:07 <@bikcmp> lol
19:08 <@bikcmp> for irondust's dns.
19:08 < aranjedeath> haha alright
19:11 < aranjedeath> When I set up cdn shit it's going to be proper though. I want buckets for people. cdn.whatever.tld/bucket_hash/filename.ext sort of thing, where they have ftp access to their bucket
19:12 < aranjedeath> simplecdn was like that
19:12 < aranjedeath> and while their latency was shit because of their providers, I did love them
19:55 <@Sue> ok
19:55 <@Sue> i'm home
19:58 < aranjedeath> hmm
19:58 < aranjedeath> have you set up b/w limiting at nagisa? I'm sitting at 125kbps flatline lmao
19:59 <@Sue> no that's minimum line speed
19:59 < aranjedeath> huh
19:59 <@Sue> you're probably feeling the QoS to prevent netflix lag
19:59 < aranjedeath> ahh okay
20:00  * aranjedeath shrugs

20:00 <@Sue> what are you downloading
20:00 < aranjedeath> 2.7gb file
20:00 < aranjedeath> lol
20:00 < aranjedeath> save you some space n.n
20:00 <@Sue> ISO on /mirror/?
20:00 < aranjedeath> nope
20:00 <@Sue> ok
20:00 < aranjedeath> my shit brah
20:00 <@Sue> dunno why i caps'd that
20:00 <@Sue> wait
20:00 <@Sue> are you removing /mirror/?
20:00 < aranjedeath> nope
20:00 <@Sue> i have plenty of space
20:01 < aranjedeath> It's not even a web facing file mang
20:01 <@Sue> ok
20:01 <@Sue> just making sure
20:01 < aranjedeath> You wouldn't have even noticed it was there, but I'm getting it off n.n

23:37 < Trublhappn> I need a better can opener
23:38 < aranjedeath> mine's awesome
23:38 < aranjedeath> It turns the can top into a lid so you can just put it into the fridge if you only use a small portion of the contents
23:38 < Trublhappn> O-o
23:38 < Trublhappn> that's fucking brilliant
23:38 < aranjedeath> It's AMAZING
23:38 < aranjedeath> yes, yes it is.

13:09 < Joey> bikcmp, i killed you for a reason
13:09 < Joey> i had to reop myself on a channel
13:13 <@bikcmp> Joey: there's chanserv for a reason
13:13 < Joey> no
13:13 < Joey> there wasn't
13:14 <@bikcmp> Joey: anyway, whatever
13:16 < Joey> also, is someone here able to transfer my domain to my server
13:17 <@bikcmp> transfer your domain?
13:17 <@bikcmp> Joey: meaning?
13:17 < Joey> yeah
13:18 < Joey> er
13:18 < Joey> i don't know the terminology
13:18 < Joey> but sue said he would do it
13:18 <@bikcmp> Joey: it's a command.
13:19 < Joey> so can i do it myself?
13:19 <@bikcmp> Joey: if you want
13:19 <@bikcmp> or i could do it
13:19 < Joey> i want to make stardustfields.net point to my server
13:19 < Joey> you could do it but if it's easy enough i can do it and at the same time you could possibly set up a mail server for me?
13:19 <@bikcmp> mail server
13:19 <@bikcmp> i have no idea
13:19 <@bikcmp> for stardustfields.net, uh
13:20 <@bikcmp> that isn't our job, that's namecheap ;p
13:20 <@bikcmp> but, point an A record to your ip
13:20 <@bikcmp> we have no control over it
13:22 < Joey> point a what
13:24 <@bikcmp> Joey: an A 
13:25 <@bikcmp> Joey: i really think you should look over this
13:25 <@bikcmp> Joey: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/dns-what-it-is-and-what-it-does.html

13:33 < Joey> 's
13:38 < Joey> bikcmp help
13:42 <@bikcmp> 18:19:46  <@bikcmp> that isn't our job, that's namecheap ;p

14:34 < Joey> but now i need to know
14:34 < Joey> how do i add subdomains and stuff
14:34 < Joey> lol
14:46 < aranjedeath> subdomains are also A records
14:51 < Joey> is there any way cpanel could be installed on my server
14:59 < aranjedeath> I'm sure there is, but I have no idea how cpanel works
15:02 < aranjedeath> ahh
15:02 < aranjedeath> the hh homepage loads so much smoother
15:04 <@bikcmp> Joey: uh
15:04 <@bikcmp> Joey: you know that cpanel costs a lot of money
15:04 <@bikcmp> right

15:05 <@bikcmp> you didn't up?
15:05 < Joey> "you know"

15:20 <@bikcmp> or rich
15:21 <@bikcmp> middle?
15:25 < Joey> why?
15:30 < iNsAn|tY> cuz bikcmp thinks only poor ppl piss on poor ppl
15:30 < iNsAn|tY> hes a racist
16:06 <@bikcmp> Joey: the school district
16:07 < Joey> there's no real info on it on the internet
16:07 < Joey> i've looked
16:07 < Joey> basically the parents and kid didn't want to press charges
16:07 < Joey> and that was it
16:07 < Joey> he got peed on
16:07 < Joey> i actually knew him, he was a childhood friend for a time
16:15 < Joey> bikcmp, or aranjedeath, or someone
16:15 < Joey> i need to add subdomains to my server
16:15 <@bikcmp> hm
16:15 <@bikcmp> Joey: dude
16:15 <@bikcmp> Joey: subdomains have NOTHING TO DO with your server ;p
16:16 < Joey> i know
16:17 < Joey> but i need them
16:17 < Joey> pls
16:17 <@bikcmp> uh
16:17 <@bikcmp> Joey: just add /a/ records
16:17 <@bikcmp> google namecheap dns
16:19 < Joey> ok
16:21 < Joey> bikcmp: INVALID_IP: 'http://108.170.18.148/irc' is not valid IP for A record. (host name: @)
16:21 <@bikcmp> ....wtf
16:21 <@bikcmp> wth did you do
16:21 <@bikcmp> lol
16:22 < Joey> what am i supposed to put in the www and @ boxes
16:22 <@bikcmp> ips
16:22 <@bikcmp> lol
16:25 < Joey> INVALID_ADDR: The address cannot be an IP address for CNAME (host name:www)
16:26 <@bikcmp> .
16:26 <@bikcmp> an /A/ record
16:26 <@bikcmp> A as in apple
16:26 < Joey> oh f i didn't see it changed
16:26 < Joey> darn forms
16:27 < Joey> okay
16:27 < Joey> but now
16:27 < Joey> if i go to http://irc.stardustfields.net/ it shows the home page
16:27 <@bikcmp> you need to configure nginx now
16:27 <@bikcmp> i'm not sure how SUE set it up
16:28 < aranjedeath> well, that's exactly what it should do
16:29 < aranjedeath> If you want to have a separate site for irc.sdf, you've gotta make nginx aware of that
16:39 < Joey> how would i do that
16:39 < Joey> nginx seems to be working fine
16:40 < aranjedeath> Have you ever connected to your server over ssh?
16:40 < Joey> yeah
16:40 < Joey> that's what i do every dayu
16:40 < Joey> *day
16:40 < aranjedeath> Oh, cool! You've got root access? Or can use sudo?
16:41 < aranjedeath> And what distribution of linux is it? Ubuntu?
16:42 < Joey> i have root access atm
16:42 < Joey> and debian
16:42 < aranjedeath> oh, awesome
16:43 < aranjedeath> the configs for nginx are in /etc/nginx/
16:44 < aranjedeath> there might be a sites directory in there, if sue set your server up
16:45 < aranjedeath> That's usually what he names it
16:47 < aranjedeath> the commands cd and ls are your friend, if you're new to ssh
16:48 < Joey> what am i looking for in nginx.conf
16:48 < aranjedeath> is there a sites folder?
16:48 < Joey> sites-available
16:48 < Joey> and
16:49 < aranjedeath> sites enabled?
16:49 < Joey> sites-enabed
16:49 < Joey> yes
16:49 < aranjedeath> what's in there
16:49 < aranjedeath> n.n
16:49 < aranjedeath> should be sitename.conf or something?
16:49 < Joey> "default" in sites-available
16:49 < aranjedeath> okay, pop it open in your editor?
16:49 < Joey> ok
16:49 < aranjedeath> there should be a server { bit?
16:50 < aranjedeath> perhaps started by listen 80; ?
16:51 < aranjedeath> If so, it's likely the correct place to be looking
16:51 < aranjedeath> So what you'll need is a location on your server for the irc.* website
16:51 < aranjedeath> I don't know where your current website code is, but somewhere near it is always easy to remember (say it's in /var/www, you could make a /var/www-irc/ or something memorable)
16:52 < Joey> what about /www/irc/
16:52 < aranjedeath> Sure, that works. Just make sure you don't have your websites all over the place. It helps so you don't forget where they are ._>
16:52 < aranjedeath> >_> *
16:53 < aranjedeath> One thing though, if you're already hosting your site from /var/www/ and you make a /var/www/irc/ of course anyone will be able to go to your site/irc/ and see that site. 
16:54 < aranjedeath> And once you've made that directory (mkdir is the command, if you don't know, `cd /var/www/ && mkdir irc` to do what you've suggested)
16:56 < aranjedeath> then go edit your /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file and copy the server block that is in there and put it up on here https://www.privatepaste.com/ or something and send it to me, I'll write it up for you real quick. 
16:56 < aranjedeath> Then you can paste it into the file below the other block and save it
16:56 < aranjedeath> then run the command `service nginx restart`
16:58 < Joey> yeah, i want people to be able to see it
16:58 < aranjedeath> cool.
17:01 < Joey> http://pastebin.com/zzQpi3Yx
17:02 < aranjedeath> oh! Your stuff is in /usr/share/nginx/www 
17:02 < aranjedeath> cools
17:02 < aranjedeath> go there and make your irc directory :D
17:03 < aranjedeath> hmm
17:03 < aranjedeath> you should change the server name!
17:03 < aranjedeath> it's localhost right now, should be what your website is
17:04 < aranjedeath> sdf.com? or whatever it was n.n
17:04 < Joey> stardustfields.net
17:06  * aranjedeath rewrites the config
17:10 < aranjedeath> do you want to always have a www on your site?
17:10 < aranjedeath> or always NOT have a www?
17:10 < aranjedeath> (for the main site)
17:10 < aranjedeath> I can add it in
17:10 < Joey> uh
17:10 < Joey> like
17:10 < Joey> www.stardustfields.net
17:10 < Joey> ?
17:10 < aranjedeath> Yep!
17:10 < aranjedeath> So when you set up the dns for it, it'll work right
17:10 < aranjedeath> which do you prefer :>
17:11 < aranjedeath> (www is not assumed, you must set up a dns A record for it)
17:11 < Joey> i'd rather always have it
17:11 < aranjedeath> Okay!
17:11 < aranjedeath> Did you get the irc `A` record set up? If so, add one for www as well
17:11 < aranjedeath> same process
17:12  * aranjedeath will make it redirect stardustfields.com to www.stardustfields.com
17:12 < aranjedeath> That sound good?
17:13 < Joey> .net
17:13 < Joey> and yeah, sounds great, thanks a bunch
17:13 < aranjedeath> oh, woops
17:13 < aranjedeath> heh
17:13 < aranjedeath> okay :>
17:17 < aranjedeath> sorry it's taking a bit
17:17 < aranjedeath> heh
17:17 < Joey> okay, did the subdomain thing
17:17 < Joey> and no prob
17:18 < aranjedeath> I'm going for `works the first time, perfectly`
17:18 < Joey> great :D
17:19 < aranjedeath> mmkay I think this should do it
17:20 < aranjedeath> http://explodie.org/default.txt 
17:20 < aranjedeath> replace your default file with that
17:20 < aranjedeath> You don't need to keep whatever is in there already
17:20 < aranjedeath> after you've saved, type `service restart nginx`
17:20 < aranjedeath> that'll make sure I haven't messed up as well
17:20 < aranjedeath> It checks the config for problems :)
17:21 < aranjedeath> and make sure it looks good
17:21 < aranjedeath> :>
17:42 < aranjedeath> mmkay, not that anyone noticed, but I slightly optimized the hh.com site
18:09 < Joey> aranjedeath, sorry, thanks for that
18:20 < aranjedeath> Joey: Make sure it works!
18:20 < aranjedeath> :D
18:20 < aranjedeath> I want to know :>
18:20 < aranjedeath> Also, vindication! Netflix's ISP-local cdn appliance for their content runs freebsd9 and nginx.
18:21 < Joey> aranjedeath: "service restart nginx" returns with an error
18:21 < Joey> bash: service: command not found
18:27 <@bikcmp> Joey: /etc/init.d/nginx restart
18:27 <@bikcmp> try that
18:33 < aranjedeath> You must be using a very old version of debian then
18:33 < Joey> hm
18:33 < Joey> www.stardustfields.net works
18:34 < Joey> but irc.stardustfields.net still redirects to home
18:34 < aranjedeath> home?
18:35 < aranjedeath> It rewrites irc.stardust to just startdust?
18:36 < Joey> yeah
18:36 < aranjedeath> well, what's in your irc folder?
18:36 < Joey> nothing
18:36 < Joey> i think that's the problem
18:36 < Joey> lol
18:36 < aranjedeath> uh
18:37 < aranjedeath> It's not redirecting properly
18:37 < aranjedeath> did you restart the server
18:37 < Joey> yeah
18:37 < aranjedeath> you're /sure/?
18:37 < aranjedeath> because it's doing what it did before, and it shouldn't be
18:37 < aranjedeath> I know I wrote the redirect correct.

18:38 < aranjedeath> It keeps the server up unless it's perfectly safe to restart it
18:38 < aranjedeath> notice you didn't see "nginx successfully started"
18:38 < aranjedeath> or something similar
18:38 < aranjedeath> you changed something in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf then?
18:39 < aranjedeath> cause it's broken somehow
18:40 < Joey> i haven't touched it
18:40 < Joey> iirc
18:40 < aranjedeath> well something did
18:41 < aranjedeath> you, sue, or anyone else who you might've given access
18:41 < aranjedeath> It doesn't come broken :D
18:41 < aranjedeath> Iunno, paste it up too? I can see if something looks off
18:42 < aranjedeath> Shouldn't need to be much of anything in nginx.conf though
18:42 < Joey> http://pastebin.com/nTkWD7mZ
18:42 < aranjedeath> yeah I don't see any glaring issues
18:42 < aranjedeath> sec
18:42 < aranjedeath> I'll compare it to ours
18:44 < aranjedeath> yeah I dunno
18:44 < aranjedeath> Ours is slightly different, but not vastly
18:45 < aranjedeath> the only difference I see on ours is a default server
18:45 < aranjedeath> but I don't know why that would be a problem
18:46 < aranjedeath> so hmm
18:47 < aranjedeath> your error message says the syntax is okay but the conf test failed
18:48 < aranjedeath> is nginx actually run as www-data user?
18:48 < Joey> i don't know
18:48 < aranjedeath> who owns the directory it is hosting from?
18:48 < Joey> i don't know, i'll try doing this as root
18:49 < aranjedeath> yes
18:49 < aranjedeath> you have to be doing all of this as root

18:50 < aranjedeath> huh
18:50 < aranjedeath> so
18:51 < aranjedeath> in nginx.conf
18:51 < aranjedeath> there's a http{ } block
18:51 < aranjedeath> shove
18:51 < aranjedeath> server {
18:51 < aranjedeath>         server_name    _;

18:51 < aranjedeath>     }
18:51 < aranjedeath> in the middle of it
18:51 < aranjedeath> wat
18:51 < aranjedeath> lemme rename that, sorry
18:52 < Joey> i will bbl
18:52 < Joey> thanks for all the hlep
18:52 < Joey> *help
18:52 < aranjedeath> server {
18:52 < aranjedeath>         server_name    _;

18:52 < aranjedeath> that, inside the http { } block somewhere. At the bottom is easiest, I suppose.
20:21 < Joey> aranjedeath: same error
20:23 < aranjedeath> No idea.
20:26 < aranjedeath> hmm
20:29 < aranjedeath> yeah I dunno, Sue or bikcmp do you have any ideas as to what's wrong? I don't see anything wrong. :/
20:39 < Joey> maybe reinstall nginx?
21:06 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i use lighttpd
21:06 <@bikcmp> and my own custom written shit
21:07 < Joey> bikcmp, is there any way i could use lighttpd and not have to reconfigure all of my subdomains and stuff
21:08 <@bikcmp> you have it configured in the first place?
21:08 <@bikcmp> lol
21:08 <@bikcmp> Joey: i use custom httpd
21:08 < Joey> could you put that on my server
21:08 < Joey> lol
21:17 <@bikcmp> Joey: no
21:17 <@bikcmp> Joey: it wouldn't work for what you want
21:18 < Joey> i just want something simple
21:18 < Joey> also, how do i unban myself from a channel using operserv
21:18 < Joey> i tried /os mode #channel -b but that didn't work

13:44 < Shadow> i could've sworn i opened default and there was the original stuff in it

13:44 <@Sue> well, it pasted twice

13:53 <@Sue> aranje made a mistake in his configs
13:53 < Shadow> ah, thank you
13:54 <@Sue> right now the way your server is set up is pretty hackish as in not how i'd usually set it up, but it's working
13:54 <@Sue> you should also have php
13:55 < Shadow> yes i do, thank youi
13:55 < Shadow> *you

15:10 <@Sue> aranjedeath: his nginx.conf was debian default
15:10 <@Sue> and he pasted his stuff in default twice
15:10 <@Sue> also your try_files broke
15:11 <@Sue> sorry, i'm earning a little money for the move
15:11 <@Sue> i have to dig and replace an entire fence
15:12 <@bikcmp> Sue: can you email me a task list
15:12 <@bikcmp> bikcmp@irondust.net
15:12 <@bikcmp> or memoserv it
15:13 < aranjedeath> my try files broke
15:13 < aranjedeath> huh
15:16 <@Sue> i'm not sure what needs done bikcmp 
15:16 <@Sue> bikcmp: how about i give you admin on the whmcs and you learn how it works
15:16 < Shadow> can someone import a mysql database for me and/or install phpmyadmin
15:17 <@bikcmp> Sue: i already know how it works
15:18 <@Sue> bikcmp: then can you set it up for me? i've gotta replace a fence
15:18 < aranjedeath> phpmyadmin -> upload -> browse -> go!
15:18 < aranjedeath> gotta know database deets!
15:18 <@Sue> bikcmp: it's already got my paypal api inserted
15:19 <@Sue> what did i set his mysql root password to...
15:19 <@bikcmp> Sue: wait
15:19 < aranjedeath> woooooooooooooow that's some dirty dubstep
15:19 <@bikcmp> Sue: uh
15:19 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i'm confused.  
15:19  * aranjedeath wobwobwobwobbles
15:19 <@Sue> lol
15:19 < aranjedeath> Don't tell me you're confused! I don't care :D
15:19 <@bikcmp> err
15:19 <@bikcmp> Sue i meant
15:19 < aranjedeath> <3
15:19 <@bikcmp> Sue: why would we want the paypal api for the vpses
15:20 <@Sue> paypal api for billing
15:20 < aranjedeath> not paypalling
15:20 <@Sue> through whmcs
15:20 <@bikcmp> Sue: yes, but we would want that for the vpses
15:20 <@bikcmp> not web sites
15:20 <@Sue> how the fuck
15:20 <@Sue> am i going to
15:20 <@Sue> take money
15:20 <@Sue> without a billing system
15:20 <@bikcmp> ... 
15:20 <@Sue> does that clarify?
15:20 <@bikcmp> Sue: you told me that i'd need to do something with vpscontrol.hardestyhosting.com.
15:20 <@bikcmp> yes?
15:20 <@Sue> yes
15:21 <@bikcmp> so we're using two seperate systems?
15:21 <@Sue> yes
15:21 <@Sue> until i can pay you to learn php
15:21 <@bikcmp> Sue: i do know php, i hate it
15:21 <@bikcmp> Sue: so
15:21 <@Sue> you know what's easier than asking me to collect from people? having an automated system that takes money from them
15:21 <@bikcmp> Sue: just to be clear.  
15:21 <@bikcmp> i'm not doing the billing system, whmcs is?
15:22 <@bikcmp> because that's on my 'todo' list that you gave me
15:22 <@Sue> ok
15:22 <@bikcmp> whmcs is doing it and i'm not?
15:22 <@Sue> hold on
15:22 <@Sue> don't assume anything until i'm done typing
15:22 <@Sue> got it?
15:22 <@Sue> i want you to sit back and not assume for like a minute
15:23 <@Sue> so the reason i grabbed whmcs is because you need to be pci secure or whatever to use authorize.net
15:23 <@Sue> which is the only way i'm going to avoid paypal, other than going to google/amazon/that one company aranje likes
15:24 <@Sue> we need to be able to directly take credit/debit
15:24 <@Sue> so unless you're pretty fucking gung ho and can make your own billing script pci-dss
15:25 <@Sue> then we should use whmcs *for now*
15:25 <@bikcmp> k
15:25 <@Sue> because i'm fucking shy as fuck
15:25 <@Sue> and can't collect from people
15:25 <@Sue> which is why to this date hardesty hosting has recieved like 20 payments over 4 years
15:25 <@Sue> unless someone else wants to be the collector
15:26 <@Sue> in which case please step forward
15:26 <@Sue> mmhmm
15:27 < Shadow> ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'Joey'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
15:27 <@Sue> now if you excuse me, i have to go rip apart a fence so i can pay rent/inject a little more money into this company
15:27 <@`> Sue: i also invested in WHMCS myself.
15:28 <@`> Sue: because i really need to collect money
15:28 <@`> Sue: i basically have the same problem you do with collectin'
15:28 <@Sue> `: that's fine, you have a control panel simple hosting company
15:28 <@`> yep.
15:28 <@`> gonna tie WHMCS into directadmin, and enom.
15:28 <@Sue> bikcmp: so could you set up the whmcs and work on the billing system?
15:29 <@Sue> i mean, set up whmcs while working on your own billing system which we will then get pci certified and linked to authorize.net
15:29 <@Sue> and then migrate all the users
15:29 <@bikcmp> well
15:30 <@bikcmp> i hate whmcs.
15:30 <@Sue> so do i
15:30 <@Sue> it's got too many options
15:31 <@Sue> do you want me to get a refund and have you whip up a paypal compatible billing system right now?
15:31 <@Sue> because it's the only way we're gonna make money (to pay you with)
15:31 <@bikcmp> well
15:31 <@bikcmp> Sue: how about we try this for a few weeks
15:32 <@bikcmp> Sue: just know that i can't 'migitate' the users very easily
15:32 <@Sue> migrate
15:32 <@bikcmp> w/e
15:32 <@bikcmp> Sue: just know that it'll be hard for me to do that.
15:32 <@Sue> it should be easy
15:32 <@Sue> just dump the mysql db, write a script to pull out the users
15:32 <@Sue> or hand copy all 10 of our customers over
15:33 <@Sue> no, 8 customers
15:40 <@bikcmp> Sue: what about the pw's
15:41 <@bikcmp> they're hashed.
15:41 <@bikcmp> Sue: tbh i could just do the billing system but yeah
15:53 < aranjedeath> hmm, is kanade still master for dns?
15:54 <@Sue> yeah
15:54 < aranjedeath> kay kay

16:33  * aranjedeath waves at him
16:42 < Shadow> and bikcmp
16:52 <@bikcmp> Shadow: i don't like mysql
16:52 <@bikcmp> also
16:52 < Shadow> i have to use it
16:52 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: my phone just arrived
16:52 <@bikcmp> Shadow: for what
16:52 < Shadow> er
16:52 < Shadow> maybe i don't have to use it
16:52 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: Newark, NJ, United States 06/07/2012 5:34 P.M. Arrived at Newark International Airport
16:52 < aranjedeath> Why are you specifically telling me?
16:53 < Shadow> bikcmp, what is an alternative
16:53 <@bikcmp> err
16:53 <@bikcmp> oh
16:53 < Shadow> sqlite?
16:53 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i didn't mean to, actually
16:53 <@bikcmp> there's a tab behind that
16:53 <@bikcmp> so it just highlighted whoever i spoke to last
16:54 < aranjedeath> Interesting. Mine requires a first letter to be typed before it completes.
16:54 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: what client?
16:54 < aranjedeath> Why ask me?
16:54 <@bikcmp> because you said 'mine' as in my client?
16:54 <@bikcmp> ;p
16:55 < aranjedeath> I did, yes. You asked me what my client was, then CTCP VERSION'd me anyway.
16:59 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: because your client didn't reply
16:59 < aranjedeath> You version'd me after you asked
17:00 < aranjedeath> box in the corner says xchat, if you must know
17:02 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: gosh, hard enough ;p
17:02 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: and, yes
17:02 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: i actually did it before
17:02 <@bikcmp> but my client lags.
17:03 < aranjedeath> Know that as of this moment, I am laughing at you.
17:03 < Shadow> bikcmp: sqlite?
17:03 < aranjedeath> Mostly because you used the words `my ________ lags`
17:04 <@bikcmp> Shadow: yes?
17:04 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: noted
17:04 < aranjedeath> I laugh at people who complain about lag. I have decided this. Because it's funny.
17:06 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: irssi throttles for ctcps
17:06 <@bikcmp> it isn't true lag
17:06 <@Sue> how is your irssi lagging
17:06 < aranjedeath> Did you try to send me 100 of them?
17:07 < aranjedeath> Cause there's no reason on earth anything should throttle a single anything.
17:07 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: no
17:07 <@bikcmp> aranjedeath: ctcps take much less priority over messages
17:07 < aranjedeath> So does UDP but that doesn't mean the packets get there late!
17:08 < Shadow> Sue, which do you think is better, mysql or sqlite?
17:08 < aranjedeath> (versus tcp)
17:08 < aranjedeath> what're you doing with the db, Shadow 
17:08 < aranjedeath> forum, blog, shooping cart, what?
17:08 < Shadow> phpbb and mediawiki
17:08 < Shadow> that's it
17:08  * aranjedeath shoop shoops
17:09 < aranjedeath> Yeah, go mysql.
17:10 < aranjedeath> sqlite is on the disk drive, which is slow as fuck to access
17:10 < aranjedeath> I guess if you don't care about how long it takes to bang out a page, either works. But mysql will be faster.
17:10 < Shadow> ok
17:11 < Shadow> so can someone now configure phpmyadmin for me?
17:14 < aranjedeath> What needs configured? pma just drops into a dir and you log in. If you don't have a database user already, that might need creating though. Sounded like you already had a root database user so you should be golden.
17:15 < Shadow> i don't think i do
17:18 < aranjedeath> so have you googled about what you want to do?
17:19 < aranjedeath> like... `setup phpmyadmin and mysql on debian` or sommat
17:20 < aranjedeath> Sue: read this:: http://blog.sidu.in/2012/06/engineering-to-business-lesson-0.html
17:22 < Shadow> aranjedeath, except i wanted my vps managed so i wouldn't have to do any of this

00:18 < Aranje> holy mother of god I'm 2600 blocks behind in bitcoin
00:18  * Aranje waits ALL THE DAYS
00:47 <@Sue> huh?

00:48 <@Aranje> I needs me a new db :>
00:48 <@Sue> phpmyadmin? we don't
00:48 <@Aranje> mm, k
00:48 <@Sue> what db, i'll make you one
00:48 <@Aranje> mostly I think I need a table under my user
00:48 <@Aranje> I'd like to contain my mess
00:48 <@Aranje> n.n
00:48 <@Sue> ok
00:49 <@Aranje> I wonder if I have a db user
00:49 <@Aranje> lol
00:49 <@Sue> database?
00:49 <@Sue> lol
00:49 <@Aranje> is there an explodie user already?
00:49 <@Aranje> r something like that?
00:50 <@Aranje> sorry about fail typing, I'm having massive i/o lag right now due to bitcoin updating 2600 blocks
09:53 <@Aranje> http://s.explodie.org/3
09:53 <@Aranje> awe yeee
09:58 <@bikcmp> Sue: can you make me a list of what you want done
09:58 <@bikcmp> Sue: also, any luck?
11:26 <@`> i dont get bitcoin. it's just a waste of cycles to me.
11:31 <@Sue> bikcmp: you have no imagination on what you think should be done?
11:37 <@Aranje> `:) I have more faith in bitcoin than in USD :P
11:53  * Aranje recodes the example homepage for his url shortener
11:54 <@`> Aranje: what do you use for your url shortener
11:54 <@Aranje> Nothing right now
11:54 <@Aranje> I got drunk last night and installed it
11:54 <@Aranje> :D
11:55 <@Aranje> http://s.explodie.org/ 
11:55 <@Aranje> I'mma rewrite the codes though :>
11:55 <@Aranje> Since that's literally the example code line for line
11:55 <@Aranje> ugleh
11:57 <@Aranje> It's light weight, and does that linkurl/linkcrap+ infopage stuff
11:57 <@Aranje> :>
12:02 <@bikcmp> Sue: yeah, but would it count towards hrly pay?
12:07 <@Aranje> `:) The other cool thing is that version upgrades are drop-in. You don't need to change anything. The first thing they have you do is put your config file in a place that won't be clobbered by overwriting everything :D
12:08 <@`> Aranje: i'd love to replace droplr with this
12:08 <@`> Aranje: what do you use?
12:09 <@Aranje> says right in my footer: http://yourls.org/
12:09 <@Aranje> this isn't a cyberlocker
12:09 <@Aranje> droplr is a cyberlocker
12:09 <@`> i know
12:09 <@`> combined with my server
12:09 <@`> }:A
12:10 <@Aranje> mmm, yeah
12:10 <@Aranje> it runs on a single mysqldb
12:10 <@Aranje> seems nice so far
12:10 <@Aranje> dunno what happens when you get 1.7bn links in it, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there
12:10 <@Aranje> comes with API examples too
12:10 <@Aranje> (and a full api)
12:10 <@Aranje> (even one that can be used without authentication)
12:11 <@Aranje> (It generates a secret key for you, so you don't have to use username/pass if it's a private shortener)
12:11 <@Aranje> also ignore the website, read the included readme
12:12 <@Aranje> their website seems to be out of date lol
12:14 <@Aranje> there's a nostats option in the config as well, to force it not to keep stats or logs of any sort (barring your webserver etc)
12:15  * ` wonders if theres a opensource cyberlocker
12:15 <@`> that also does url shortening.
12:19  * Aranje dunno
12:25 <@Sue> well, results from openstack are: there's no fucking way i'm setting it up for us
12:25 <@Sue> although it's pretty goddamn amazing
12:25 <@`> you were all "omfg *cum*"
12:25 <@`> what happened
12:25 <@Aranje> This is common
12:25 <@`> so i've noticed, Aranje 
12:25 <@Sue> no
12:25 <@`> Sue: so what's the cockblock this time with openstack?
12:26 <@Sue> i want it so fucking badly, but you have to do all sorts of shit to set it up
12:26 <@Sue> i don't even know how iscsi works
12:27 <@Sue> if someone else with less of a complex could set it up
12:27 <@Sue> less of a perfection complex
12:27 <@Sue> this is the wall i hit 99% of the time
12:28 <@Sue> i got it from my dad
12:28 <@`> learn.
12:28 <@`> iSCSI looks to be completely badass
12:29 <@Aranje> perfection is the enemy of good enough
12:29 <@`> ^
12:29 <@Aranje> Both are the enemy of `haha! It works, motherfuckers!`
12:29 <@Aranje> :3
12:31 <@`> but then again, it's Sue
12:31 <@`> :P
12:34 <@Sue> i want haha it works
12:34 <@`> then use it.
12:34 <@`> and learn it.
12:34 <@Sue> but the least i can do is TOO HACKISH FUCK RM -F
12:35 <@`> uh, theres not much else
12:35 <@Sue> if you want an example of me pulling off haha! it works!, look at my freebsd box
12:35 <@Sue> the sheer willpower it took to stop caring about the hacks
12:36 <@Aranje> um
12:36 <@Aranje> hacks are how the world works, motherfucker
12:36 <@`> ^
12:36 <@`> and you're coming into a industry of hacks.
12:36 <@Aranje> You know why every higher level sysadmin job needs perl?
12:36 <@Aranje> cause of hacks.
12:36 < iNsAn|tY> the world is a betatest
12:36 <@`> this, exactly.
12:37 <@Aranje> I'm close to writing a logfile parser for nagisa in perl
12:37 <@Aranje> It's going to be one HUGE hack
12:37 <@Aranje> and probably several lines of mitigating my own incompetency
12:37 <@Aranje> But ya know what? It'll work.
12:38 <@Aranje> And that's all that matters
12:38 < iNsAn|tY> yep
12:41 <@Sue> i'll learn
12:41 <@Sue> i
12:41 <@`> Sue: i'll learn too }:A
12:41 < iNsAn|tY> got some customers cooking?
12:41 <@Sue> i'm trying to learn python
12:42 <@`> Sue: we're definitely confirmed for next weekend?
12:42 <@Sue> yeah
12:42 <@`> alright, cool
12:42 <@Sue> fyi, this is gonna be hard
12:42 <@`> i know.
12:44 <@`> just kinda wish i still had that house that you visited
12:44 <@`> massive space everywhar
12:44 <@`> fucking landlord screwed me over
12:44 <@`> let it foreclose from under me
12:45 <@Aranje> I just thought everyone should know that Microsoft is committed to supporting visual basic 6 in windows 8. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ms788708.aspx
12:45 <@Aranje> Damn, I almost said that with a straight face
12:47 <@`> lol
12:51  * Aranje fights to make his forms pretty
12:52 <@Sue> apt-get install -y mysql-server python-mysqldb
12:52 <@Sue> oops
12:52 <@Aranje> haha fucking win
12:52 <@Sue> i was trying to copy that link for miek
12:52 <@Aranje> now my url shortener's form autofocuses in modern browsers :3
12:52 <@Aranje> http://s.explodie.org/
12:52 <@Aranje> much improved
12:52 <@Sue> nice
12:52 <@Aranje> n.n
12:52 <@Aranje> working on making it `perfect`
12:52 <@Aranje> :P
12:53 <@Aranje> Mostly because it's inconsequential
12:53 <@Aranje> :>
12:53 <@Aranje> but that's the homepage, still need the submitted button
12:55  * ` would center the form
12:56 <@`> it's weird aligned to the left, with the container stretched wide
12:56 <@`> really weird.
12:58 <@`> and the navigation collapse seems weird to me too
12:58 <@`> i'd just put "Home | Admin" to the right side at the upper-right corner
13:21 <@Aranje> motherfucker I am not taking input yet
13:22 <@Aranje> I'm trying to figure out why my form prepends and things don't work :|
13:32 <@Sue> lol
13:37 <@Aranje> helps when it's class="container" not id="container"
13:37 <@Aranje> fuuuu
13:49 <@Sue> we still need to address the ip allocation issue
13:49 <@Sue> and i don't think openstack is right for us at this moment
14:29 <@bikcmp> ok
14:29 <@bikcmp> hm
14:30 <@bikcmp> Sue: so.  stuff i'm doing atm will be based on per hour spent?

15:21 <@Sue> i only said i'd pay you because i really need a programmer
15:21 <@bikcmp> Sue: 15.00?
15:21 <@bikcmp> that works for me
15:21 <@Sue> what
15:21 <@Sue> 1500
15:21 <@bikcmp> 1500 what
15:21 <@bikcmp> usd?

15:21 <@Sue> which i don't have
15:21 <@bikcmp> i'm confused.

15:28  * Aranje waits for %'s in the future, not hourly now
15:30 <@Sue> yeah
15:30 <@Sue> i said i'd pay him 50 the first month, but i really don't think proper wages will even work out
15:31 <@Sue> i can be totally transparent in how much money this company has
15:31 <@Sue> we have 40 bucks left
15:31 <@Sue> flat
15:33 <@bikcmp> wth
15:33 <@bikcmp> Sue: hmm

15:33  * Joey grabs the post-its
15:34  * Joey grabs a crappy pencil
15:34  * Joey writes I O U on a post it and sticks it on the userlist
15:34 <@Sue> basically
15:34 <@Sue> once we hit a steady income, then i'm going to be paying out
15:34 <@Sue> i'm not using any of the company money on myself
15:35 <@`> nor am I.
15:35 <@`> it's all going into the company.
15:35  * Aranje hasn't ever seen company money :DDDD
15:35 <@`> in fact, i had to spend quite a bit of my own money setting things up
15:35 < Joey> we took our shifting losses
15:36 < Joey> and put them into businessses
15:36 < Joey> that we actually own
15:36 < Joey> and then the balance sheet
15:36 < Joey> it showed
15:36 < Joey> profit
15:36 < Joey> but actually there was
15:36 < Joey> debt
15:36  * Joey throws a chair at bikcmp
15:36 <@`> yeah
15:36 <@bikcmp> Sue: k
15:36 <@bikcmp> Sue: but when we /do/ make a steady income, what will it look like for me
15:36 <@Aranje> Money, I'd guess
15:37 <@bikcmp> $50 initial that's owed to me
15:37 <@bikcmp> and, hm
15:37 <@bikcmp> i'll start writing down hours spent on $task.
15:37 <@bikcmp> CA min wage?
15:37 <@bikcmp> iirc it's $8?
15:37 <@Aranje> yeah
15:37 <@bikcmp> $8 even?
15:37 <@bikcmp> k
15:38 <@bikcmp> Sue: and hour limit per week = ?

00:40 <@Aranje> I want... what I really want... is to find one with a collar. That way I can hook the back of the collar on a cast iron fence and pick her up, choking her lightly as I fuck her against the fence.
00:40 <@Aranje> Is that too elaborate?
00:40 <@Aranje> :D
00:41 <@Aranje> wrought iron!

16:11 <@Aranje> Y U NO hostserv or #vhost
16:11 <@Aranje> lol
16:12 <@Aranje> not even your nickserv has a host option :|
16:12 <@bikcmp> Aranje: uh
16:12 <@bikcmp> #vhost redirects to #help ;p
16:12 < Trublhappn> somebody has your name on the hydrocitygaming forums aranje
16:12 <@Aranje> Perhaps it used to, but it doesn't anymore
16:12 <@bikcmp> Aranje:  i can assure you it does
16:12 <@bikcmp> lol
16:12 <@Aranje> * Now talking on #vhost
16:12 <@Aranje> * wolfram.irondust.net sets mode +n #vhost
16:12 <@Aranje> * wolfram.irondust.net sets mode +t #vhost
16:12 <@Aranje> * You have left channel #vhost (Gone)
16:12 <@bikcmp> IRC_DEDIR(): 17:12 -!- #vhost #help Forwarding to another channel
16:13 <@bikcmp> lol
16:13 <@bikcmp> Aranje: nah, i just changed it.  
16:13 <@bikcmp> Aranje: anyway, what did you want?
16:13 <@bikcmp> we don't do vanity cloaks
16:13 <@Aranje> what is vanity cloak
16:13 <@bikcmp> like
16:13 <@bikcmp> a 'fun' cloak?
16:13 <@bikcmp> I.AM.KING would be an example
16:13 <@Aranje> What you mean to say is that I can't set my own cloak
16:13 <@bikcmp> yes, that's a better way
16:14  * Aranje leers
16:14 < Trublhappn> *O_o
16:14 <@bikcmp> Aranje: basically, we use cloaks to show affiliation towards a channel
16:14 <@bikcmp> or status.
16:14 <@Aranje> Unfortunate. 
16:14 < Trublhappn> ... Runescape?
16:14 <@Aranje> That's not what I want it for.
16:14 <@bikcmp> Aranje: what did you want?
16:14 <@bikcmp> just any cloak?
16:15 < Trublhappn> Cloak... which game?
16:15 <@Aranje> I want it to hide the end of my host, so I don't get people asking me if I live in medford oregon
16:15 <@Aranje> Because I don't.
16:15 < Trublhappn> nvm, computer stuff.

16:16 <@Aranje> n.n
16:16 <@Aranje> thanks :)
16:17 <@bikcmp> i'm bored as crap
16:17 < Trublhappn> I'm playing runescape and watching breaking bad
16:17 < Trublhappn> Pretty damn bored
16:18 <@bikcmp> hmm
16:18 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: sue?
16:18 <@bikcmp> i don't think i've met you
16:18 < Trublhappn> I'm the business major
16:18 <@bikcmp> oh
16:18 <@bikcmp> nice
16:19 < Trublhappn> What I know about servers could fit in a thimble, but what I know about making money...
16:19 <@bikcmp> then do it
16:19 <@bikcmp> and give me 90% :x
16:19 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: one day i'd like to turn irondust into a self supporting business
16:19 <@bikcmp> it'd be quite cool
16:21 < Trublhappn> I'm more than okay with turning nothing into something. Especially if it helps pay the rent
16:21 <@bikcmp> haha, yah
16:22 <@bikcmp> i'm trying to get a decent userbase first
16:22 <@Aranje> spoken like a real business major
16:22 <@bikcmp> then maybe do something.
16:22 < Trublhappn> Okay, so what exactly do you do?
16:22 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: for hardesty?
16:22 < Trublhappn> Yep
16:22 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: I'm a coder.
16:22 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: http://vpscontrol.hardestyhosting.com/
16:22 < Trublhappn> Coding, that's exceptionally good.
16:23 <@bikcmp> yeah.
16:23 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: I made a simplistic crm/vps control panel.
16:23 < Trublhappn> And that is exactly?
16:23  * Aranje grins
16:24 < Trublhappn> Remember, thimble.
16:24 <@Aranje> crm = customer relationship management software
16:24 < Trublhappn> Oh, so you made a baseball bat?
16:24 < Trublhappn> Only good way to deal with a customer @_@
16:26 < Trublhappn> hold on, burning bacon
16:27  * Aranje compiles ircd
16:27 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: basically, it holds info about the users.
16:28 <@Aranje> Fancy crm's can do things like deal with support tickets, manage contact between company and users, manage payments etc
16:28 <@Aranje> neat stuff
16:28 < Trublhappn> awesome, so basically it manages customers for me, this I am a fan of
16:28 <@Aranje> yes
16:28 <@bikcmp> yeah
16:28 <@bikcmp> Aranje: well
16:28 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i could put that in there, if i'm /told to/
16:28 <@bikcmp> i need specific tasks :-p
16:29 <@bikcmp> if you want it, i'll do it.
16:29 < Trublhappn> ... Put that in there O_o
16:29 <@Aranje> You're in a startup and you're not a self starter? pfffffft
16:29  * Aranje stares at sugarcrm
16:29 < Trublhappn> Not that I want to trash you, but aranje has a point xD
16:29 <@Aranje> is big and ugly, but does all the things
16:29 < Trublhappn> okay
16:30 < Trublhappn> speaking of slacking off
16:30 < Trublhappn> who wants to play LoL?
16:30 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: ok
16:30  * Aranje grins
16:30 <@bikcmp> Trublhappn: i keep a list of what i do, in a task list
16:30 <@bikcmp> with time spent.
16:30 < Trublhappn> For later billing :P
16:30 <@Aranje> y u tied to time so much
16:30 <@bikcmp> so when Sue gets enough money, yeah
16:31 <@bikcmp> exactly
16:31 < Trublhappn> I know how it goes
16:31 <@bikcmp> i'm not too concerned with it, but it's also you know
16:31 < Trublhappn> Believe me, I know.
16:31 <@bikcmp> if we're a for profit company, i'd like to make a small cut or some wage
16:31 <@bikcmp> yah
16:31 < Trublhappn> I don't do charity cases
16:31 < Trublhappn> On the one hand, if this tanks, that's cool. I've not invested 40 a week on it or anything
16:31 <@Sue> ohboyherewego
16:32 < Trublhappn> but if does well, then yeah, imma like me some money :P
16:32 < Trublhappn> at the moment I'm kinda deadweight, I don't know enough about servers or coding to do anything useful or productive
16:32 < Trublhappn> but until we have a finished product I've got nothing I can sell.
16:32 <@Aranje> you can look at the market we're in and determine pricing
16:33 < Trublhappn> For which games specifically.
16:33 <@Aranje> also does calculating xpe give you as much joy as it does me?
16:33 < Trublhappn> I need to know what we can support exactly.
16:33 < Trublhappn> Noob question: Xpe?
16:33 < Trublhappn> and burning bacon brb
16:33 <@Aranje> cross price elasticity
16:34 < Trublhappn> Actually it does
16:34 <@Aranje> It was one of my favorite things
16:34 <@Aranje> lol
16:34 < Trublhappn> it also makes me wonder how much we're going to be able to charge
16:34 <@Aranje> :>
16:34 < Trublhappn> and which games will be the most cash per energy spent
16:34 <@Aranje> I'm not a business major, but uh... I've taken a few classes n.n
16:34 < Trublhappn> We've got some heavy hitters here charging for half what we need.
16:35 < Trublhappn> It'd almost be better just to run the servers ourselves and make money off of subscriptions/donations.
16:36 <@`> this.
16:36 <@`> this is why sue is all "we own the hardware. period."
16:36 <@Aranje> ^
16:37 < Trublhappn> Quite honestly, with server hosting, it's a steadier income
16:37 <@Aranje> oh you're talking about mc hosting?
16:37 < Trublhappn> Not necessarily
16:37 <@Aranje> haha I was lost and wondering why all the talk of games
16:37 <@Aranje> >_>
16:37 < Trublhappn> MC is great at the moment but there's steadier servers
16:37 < Trublhappn> CSS, as much as I hate the game has been around forever
16:38 <@Aranje> yeah.
16:38 < Trublhappn> TF2 is good money
16:38 <@Aranje> oh man
16:38 <@Sue> i'm enjoying this
16:38 <@Sue> so much brain
16:38 < Trublhappn> Then you get into private servers of legal games
16:38 <@Aranje> and we can run some of the only good west coast servers
16:38 < Trublhappn> bit shady
16:38 < Trublhappn> but serious money
16:38 <@`> Sue: ditto.
16:38 <@Aranje> cause eh, nobody hosts west coast servers
16:38 <@Aranje> there's like 20 of em
16:38 <@Aranje> so many millions of people here
16:39 <@`> yep
16:39 <@`> CA has what, 4 mil people?
16:39 <@Aranje> I want to try running an empires server at some point, but we don't have the hardware for it
16:39 < Trublhappn> ^_^
16:39 < Trublhappn> Okay
16:39 <@Aranje> nothing we own is fast enough for empires
16:39 < Trublhappn> So
16:39 < Trublhappn> MC I know for damn sure can make money
16:39 <@Aranje> yeah. lag free mc is a godsend worth paying for.
16:39 < Trublhappn> people will pay $5 a month just for a shiny name 
16:39 <@Sue> please keep bouncing ideas off each other
16:40 <@Aranje> also counterstrike global offensive or w/e is out soon
16:40 <@`> i honestly don't really do video games
16:40 <@`> i barely even play 'em
16:40 <@Aranje> dunno if that's hostable
16:40 <@Aranje> it's fine
16:40 <@Sue> you know what this means?
16:40 <@Aranje> you can run a command
16:40 < Trublhappn> And that's going to be a godsend for any server that can get a copy
16:40 <@Sue> `: hosting is not playing
16:40 <@`> most of my preferences lean towards RPGs
16:40 <@Aranje> make a short script for angel'ing the game server process
16:40 <@`> Sue: i know.
16:40 <@Aranje> then you're good
16:40 <@Sue> hardesty networks needs a gaming DBA
16:40 < Trublhappn> Not too many privately owned RPG servers 
16:41 <@Sue> not hardesty gaming
16:41 <@Aranje> nah, we'll just do things
16:41 <@Aranje> hardesty hosting == doesn't say what we're hosting
16:41 <@Sue> ok
16:41 <@Aranje> don't go crazy with paperwork
16:41 <@Sue> but we need something like hurfdurf gaming server
16:41 <@Aranje> you're just gonna rage later
16:41 <@Aranje> lol
16:41 <@`> but
16:41 <@`> i do like CS a lot.
16:41 <@Aranje> Hardesty Hosting Game Servers ?
16:41 <@`> grew up around it.
16:41 <@Aranje> lol
16:42 <@Sue> HH servers
16:42 <@Aranje> da
16:42 < Trublhappn> HardestyHosting works just fine
16:42 <@`> Aranje: i was thinking along the lines of that
16:42 <@Sue> or HH gaming
16:42 <@Aranje> hh gaming uses a lot less chars
16:42 <@Aranje> lol
16:42 <@`> yep
16:42 <@`> gaming.hardestyhosting.com
16:42 <@`> etc
16:42 < Trublhappn> I used to play on a server for Wolfenstein Enemy Territory named GirlPower
16:42 <@Aranje> basically
16:42 <@Aranje> haha fuck yeah wolfet
16:42 <@Sue> we need a w:et server
16:42 < Trublhappn> Names can be pretty damn generic
16:42 <@Sue> for old times sakes
16:42 <@`> w:et?
16:42 < Trublhappn> xD
16:42 <@Aranje> dude, ID took down the wolfet game-search servers
16:42 <@`> oh
16:42 <@Aranje> it's dead
16:42 <@Sue> noooo
16:42 < Trublhappn> aww
16:42 <@Aranje> except
16:42 <@Aranje> not really
16:43 < Trublhappn> Get on mumble jackass :P
16:43 <@Aranje> because someone reverse engineered the server search protocol and wrote their own
16:43 <@Aranje> then rehosted
16:43 <@Sue> oh good
16:43 <@Aranje> new IP
16:43 <@`> Trublhappn: /me is deaf :D
16:43 <@Aranje> hosts file goodness
16:43 < Trublhappn> I'm not calling you jackass :D
16:43 <@`> Trublhappn: just saying.
16:43 <@`> :D
16:43 <@Sue> so basically
16:43 <@`> and who are you calling jackass, jackass? ;)
16:43 <@Sue> we can do hh gaming as a demo of our network
16:43 < Trublhappn> xD
16:43 < Trublhappn> arange :P
16:44 <@`> Sue: yeah
16:44 <@`> Sue: one thing i've always wanted to do
16:44 <@`> Sue: and that's a LAN party
16:44 <@Sue> heh
16:44 <@Aranje> [ALERT] 91.220.53.73 etmaster.idsoftware.com 
16:44 < Trublhappn> we should totally throw up a W:ET super quick >_>
16:44 <@Aranje> hosts file
16:44 <@Sue> as long as we aren't running a gaming cafe, those suck ass
16:44 <@Aranje> but but but
16:44 <@Sue> and i will open that coffee shop Aranje 
16:44 <@Aranje> max and I did the stuff for that shit
16:44 <@Aranje> lulz
16:45 <@Sue> you remember the coffee shop
16:45 <@`> Sue: i did run a gaming center at one time
16:45 <@Aranje> secondshop nigga
16:45 < Trublhappn> If there is a coffee shop to be opened I'm calling dibs
16:45 < Trublhappn> That was my original idea O_o
16:45 <@Sue> actually
16:45 <@`> Sue: it was called LAN Mine Gaming Center
16:45 <@`> }:A
16:45 <@Aranje> rented laptops in a coffee shop for playing games on
16:45 <@`> not my choice, but yeah
16:45 <@Sue> me Aranje and two chicks from HS did a project for a coffee shop
16:45 <@`> Sue: >laptops in a coffee shop
16:45 <@Aranje> Yes.
16:46 <@`> you can bet some assholes will try to steal the fuckers
16:46 <@`> no
16:46 <@Aranje> Yep
16:46 <@Sue> Aranje: didn't i wear a dress for that presentation?
16:46 <@Aranje> and we've got their ID and card numbers
16:46 <@Aranje> :P
16:46 <@Aranje> I believe so
16:46 <@Sue> that was heeelarious
16:46 <@`> i'd hide desktops (or racked hardware) and then wire down to the terminal
16:46 <@Aranje> laptops can only be checked out with valid ID
16:46 <@Aranje> was the thing
16:46 <@`> so the only thing in the open is the HIDs
16:46 < Trublhappn> Me and my buddies wanted to totally find somewhere with free WiFi
16:46 <@Aranje> also stick a buzzer on the back of it
16:46 <@Aranje> good to go
16:46 <@bikcmp> ok
16:46 <@bikcmp> so
16:46 <@bikcmp> a 'tiket' system?
16:46 < Trublhappn> Then take our wireless Towers and drag em out to this coffee shop or w/e
16:46 < Trublhappn> and have a lan party there.
16:46 <@`> lol
16:46 <@Sue> ticket
16:47 <@`> i've always wanted to setup a wifi relay
16:47 <@Aranje> If you want to write a support ticket system, not gonna complain, but we don't need it immediately
16:47 <@Aranje> we can use something like zensupport or w/e
16:47 <@Aranje> zendesk
16:47 <@Aranje> that's the one
16:47 <@Sue> it's less the paperwork issue and more we need divisions
16:47 < Trublhappn> kinda wanna play ET:QW
16:47 <@`> Aranje: use WHMCS' built in ticketing system for now?
16:47 <@Aranje> sure!
16:47 <@Aranje> I know nothing about ya'll payment stuff
16:47 <@Aranje> LO
16:47 <@Sue> `: simple hosting division
16:47 <@Aranje> er, :P
16:48 <@Sue> bikcmp: backend division
16:48 < Trublhappn> anyways
16:48 <@Sue> Aranje: beer division
16:48 < Trublhappn> I'm going to get on LoL
16:48 <@Aranje> done
16:48 <@`> Sue: i'm Deaf Geeks Design, hired by HH
16:48 <@Sue> Trublhappn: gaming division
16:48 < Trublhappn> xD
16:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: backend division?
16:48 <@Sue> load balancing, etc
16:48 <@`> to "manage" the Simple Hosting division of HH
16:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: what do you mean
16:48 <@bikcmp> oh
16:48 <@`> Sue: thoughts?
16:48 <@Aranje> So does this mean I have to go get a brew kit? Hardesty Hosting honey mead, anyone?
16:48 <@`> lol
16:48 <@`> that'd be badass
16:48 <@`> sold *only* to sysadmins
16:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: ok.  so, what would I do?
16:49 <@bikcmp> make sure shit stays online? 
16:49 <@`> we'd verify each order so we know the buyer's a sysadmin
16:49 <@`> }:A
16:49 <@Aranje> :>
16:49 <@`> that'd be cool, actually
16:49 <@Sue> `: no, i'm "buying you" and making you owner of hardesty networks DBA deaf geeks design
16:49 <@`> niche bullshit
16:49 <@Aranje> yeah
16:49 < Trublhappn> o.o Quake Wars is 2$ O_o
16:49 <@Aranje> I'll make a ginger beer too
16:49 <@Sue> holy shit
16:49 <@Aranje> cause those are delicious
16:49 <@Sue> Trublhappn: right now?
16:49 <@Aranje> and a uh
16:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: so, what should i do with the ticket system? should I do it?
16:49 <@Aranje> doppelbach
16:50 <@bikcmp> Sue: any ideas on what to do?
16:50 < Trublhappn> amazon has it for 2$ at 14 stores...
16:50 <@Aranje> wait on that, bikcmp 
16:50 < Trublhappn> as a PC game
16:50 <@Aranje> what do we have so far
16:50 <@bikcmp> k
16:50 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i have a very simplistic vps manager
16:50 <@Aranje> what features does your code has
16:50 <@bikcmp> and a basic crm.
16:50 <@Sue> bikcmp: not right now
16:50 <@Aranje> okay, what does it do?
16:50 <@Sue> we need the crm to be clean first
16:50 <@`> Sue: problem is i want to keep my company on its own; but tightly coupled with HH/HN
16:50 <@Aranje> launch vps? rm vps? one click reinstall? what?
16:50 <@Aranje> etc
16:50 <@bikcmp> Aranje: you can add users, modify notes and stuff
16:50 <@Aranje> mmkay
16:50 <@bikcmp> modify first name, last name, phone
16:50 <@bikcmp> etc
16:50 <@bikcmp> delete users, make users
16:50 <@Aranje> add users on vps or on interface?
16:51 <@bikcmp> Aranje: interface
16:51 <@Aranje> oh, okay
16:51 <@`> Sue: i'm sure we can hash it over when you get here.
16:51 <@Sue> yeah
16:51 <@bikcmp> i don't know how to integrate it with libvirt very well without breaking sue's shit
16:51 <@`> Sue: as i've already gotten an DBA

17:32 <@`> lols
17:32 < AndroUser> Bbl
17:32 <@`> gotta love the mirror effect
17:32 <@Aranje> I don't want a camera. Requires me to plug it in when I want to use it. And they cost money, which is a no-go for something I don't really want.
17:33 <@`> Aranje: i got my cams for free
17:33 <@`> Aranje: and the cheap ones are sufficient; at thrift shops and such
17:33 <@Aranje> I've taped over the one on my laptop
17:33 <@Aranje> thank god debian doesn't support it anyway
17:33 <@`> seriously?
17:34 <@Aranje> Yeap.
17:34 <@`> i use it almost religiously
17:34 <@`> because it allows for the use of Video Relay
17:34 <@Aranje> I hate video cameras.
17:34 <@Aranje> It's one of the main reasons I don't want a smart phone
17:34 <@Aranje> they have giant cameras on them
17:35 <@Aranje> screenception
17:35 < Trublhappn> Droid4 doesn't have a removable battery
17:35 < Trublhappn> It makes me exceptionally paranoid.
17:35 <@Aranje> Yeah I don't want my phone to have a camera on it
17:35 <@Aranje> or a gps chip
17:35 <@`> http://dgd.io/1QzC
17:36 <@Aranje> or wireless capabilities
17:36 < Trublhappn> well, good luck finding one like that in a year
17:36 <@Aranje> Haha my shit phone already has gps and camera
17:36 <@Aranje> I hate it
17:36 <@`> heh yeah
17:36 <@Aranje> I carry it around as little as possible
17:36 <@`> oh fuck yeah

17:37 <@Aranje> GIANT FACE
17:38 <@Aranje> also neat for signing stuff, yeah
17:38 <@Aranje> I just don't like the damn things
17:38 <@Aranje> I like objects and programs that do one thing well
17:38 <@Aranje> Not this `let's pack 120 devices into your phone!` shit
17:38 <@Aranje> If I want to take pictures motherfucker I'll bring a camera. I didn't buy one for nothing.
17:38 <@`> well
17:39 <@`> i like the fact that everything's "bundled" into my phone
17:39 <@Aranje> that is exactly what I don't like
17:39 <@Aranje> :P
17:39 <@`> i dont have to bring a multitude of gadgets just to accomplish different things
17:41 <@Aranje> I love bringing lots of things, it means every capability I have will be done well, not mediocre
17:41 <@Aranje> but eh, I'm weird
17:41 <@Aranje> I hate laptops because they do wireless
17:41 <@Aranje> go figure
17:42  * Aranje hates wireless
17:42 <@Aranje> We've been trying wireless for like 20 or 30 years now, still can't get it right
17:42 <@Aranje> so sad
17:43 <@`> heh
17:43 <@Aranje> When I look at laptops I view them as portable desktops
17:43 <@`> there's a huge disparity between capability of speed between wired and wireless
17:43 <@`> which annoys me
17:43 <@Aranje> because mine sits on my desk plugged into gbit eth all day erry day
17:44  * ` shrugs
17:44 <@Aranje> speed doesn't even bother me
17:44 <@Aranje> the fact that it never works correctly bothers me
17:44 <@`> i run gigabit and .11n
17:44 <@Aranje> I don't have anything n-capable
17:44 < Trublhappn> I'm stealing my internet from two different neighbors

20:57 <@Aranje> run it in fucking screen
20:57 <@Aranje> jesus christ
20:57 <@Aranje> type `screen` then enter
20:57 <@Aranje> then your command
20:58 <@Aranje> wherever it is
20:58 <@Aranje> and then ctrl+d and it'll disconnect
20:58 <@Aranje> it'll run as long as it needs to.
20:59 <@Aranje> if you need to bother whatever you want to run again, connect up and go `screen -r`
20:59 <@Aranje> (-r like resume!)
21:00 < Shadow> <@Aranje> then your command
21:00 < Shadow> er
21:00 < Shadow> wrong copy
21:00 < Shadow> lol
21:00 < Shadow> bash: screen: command not found
21:00 <@Aranje> good going
21:00 <@Aranje> how did you manage that?
21:00 <@Aranje> If you're running debian, which you said previously, it should have screen
21:00 < Shadow> i don't fucking know
21:00 <@Aranje> all debian has screen
21:00 <@Aranje> apt-get install screen asshole
21:01 <@Aranje> though if necessary you can omit asshole
21:01 <@Aranje> it's not necessary to the command
21:01 < Shadow> t(^_^ )
21:01 <@Aranje> I'm drunk and it's sunday
21:01 < Shadow> don't you mean you're sunday and it's drunk?
21:01 <@Aranje> Work week? Nope!
21:01 <@Aranje> Nah
21:02 <@bikcmp> apt-get install screen
21:04 < Shadow> sh: ./home/ircd/qwebirc/run.py: Permission denied
21:04 < Shadow> THIS
21:04 < Shadow> THIS IS WHAT ANNOYS ME THE MOST
21:04 <@bikcmp> python
21:04 <@Aranje> why sh
21:04 <@bikcmp> not sh
21:04 <@Aranje> ^
21:05 <@Aranje> IT'S A PY NOT A SH
21:05 <@Aranje> :|
21:05 <@bikcmp> well
21:05 <@bikcmp> Aranje: if it had +x it'd work too
21:05 <@bikcmp> assuming it had the shebang
21:05 <@Aranje> but but but SH
21:05 <@bikcmp> i suspect it does
21:05 <@Aranje> NOT PY
21:05 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i'd imagine he just ./'ed it
21:05 <@bikcmp> lol
21:05 <@bikcmp> hm
21:05 <@bikcmp> Aranje: lighters are fun.
21:05 <@bikcmp> not even joking
21:06 < Shadow> i did
21:06 < Shadow> do that
21:06 < Shadow> what should i do now
21:06 <@bikcmp> python mf

21:09 <@bikcmp> and, before you ask
21:09 <@bikcmp> i have no idea
21:09 <@bikcmp> lol
21:32 < Shadow> bikcmp, the thing is i don't have the time or patience to be dealing with something like this
21:32 < Shadow> so could you please just do it for me
21:39 <@bikcmp> Shadow: i have no idea how
21:39 <@bikcmp> and i don't have time
21:40 < Shadow> is it okay if i run it as root
21:42 < iNsAn|tY> su - root
21:42 < iNsAn|tY> <enter pass>
21:42 < iNsAn|tY> rm / -rf
21:42 < iNsAn|tY> then go
21:42 < iNsAn|tY> :)
21:43 < Shadow> well, yeah, i know how to
21:43 < Shadow> lol
21:43 < Shadow> but should I?
21:47 <@Aranje> dude shadow
21:47 <@Aranje> you're so bad
21:48 <@Aranje> you're trying to run something in root's HOME DIRECTORY as the user ircd
21:48 < Shadow> <Shadow> t(^_^ )
21:48 <@Aranje> that will never work.
21:48 < Shadow> i can't wait to show you these logs lol
21:48 <@Aranje> Do you have any idea how permissions work?
21:48 <@Aranje> not in linux
21:48 <@Aranje> I mean the concept
21:48 <@Aranje> in general
21:48 <@Aranje> because that's 90% of what you're messing up
21:49 <@Aranje> If you're ircd, you CAN NOT launch shit in root's dir
21:49 <@Aranje> (there are cases where that isn't true, but we're going to ignore them because frankly they're edge cases and irrelevant).
21:51 <@Aranje> also iNsAn|tY: You're fucking retarded. You can't even troll someone, you're giving them the wrong fucking command. DERP.
21:52 < iNsAn|tY> im fucking retarded?
21:52 <@Aranje> rm / -rf? seriously? You've got the fucking arguments wrong!

21:54 < Shadow> this is going to be so funny to show to you tomorrow

11:14 <@Aranje> I don't somehow become another person when drunk
11:14 < Shadow> it was hilarious though

11:16 < Shadow> ...yes
11:16 < Shadow> lol
11:17 <@Aranje> That isn't any different from me normally
11:17 < Shadow> it seems like it is

20:58 <@bikcmp> there's the hard version.
20:59 <@Aranje> so far I like this version even less
20:59 <@bikcmp> and i'm the deaf one
20:59 <@Aranje> yeah
20:59 <@bikcmp> god
20:59 <@Aranje> and it has a shitty male singer
20:59 <@bikcmp> Aranje: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjl-QujHpb8&feature=related
21:00 <@bikcmp> Aranje: there's a /completely/ different type
21:00 <@Aranje> I'll just tell you now, you're not likely to be able to actually link me to a song I really like
21:00 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i noticed
21:00 <@Aranje> and this sirens stuff is just run of the mill club sounding shit
21:01 <@Aranje> booooooooring
21:01 <@Aranje> And it has none of the bits of club music I like
21:01 <@Aranje> sad
21:01 <@bikcmp> Aranje: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM40zV9VFOI
21:01 <@bikcmp> don't like it, i give up
21:02 <@Aranje> still plucky and light
21:02 <@Aranje> haha same reason I hated owl city
21:02 <@Aranje> which is apparently the band that came after this one
21:02 <@Aranje> lulz
21:02 <@Aranje> ugh
21:02 <@Aranje> god his voice is horrible
21:03 <@Aranje> It grates on my face

21:06 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i love dp
21:06 <@bikcmp> which song are you talking about
21:06 <@Aranje> Harder Better Faster Stronger is the only one I can stand by them
21:06 <@bikcmp> i hate that song
21:06 <@bikcmp> eh
21:06 <@bikcmp> well
21:06 <@bikcmp> not hate
21:06 <@bikcmp> but prefer others.
21:06 <@Aranje> Not your favorite :P
21:06 <@bikcmp> :P
21:07 <@Aranje> I can tolerate that song
21:07 <@Aranje> I don't love it, but it's okay
21:07 < Joey> http://www.stardustfields.net/chat.htm
21:08 <@Aranje> mmmm
21:08 <@Aranje> oh this song is all the things I want right now
21:08 <@bikcmp> Aranje: you might not actually like the song
21:08 <@bikcmp> but the words are funny, or so i read
21:08 <@bikcmp> lol
21:08 <@bikcmp> Aranje: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q6hYpR6Oyg
21:09 <@Aranje> lol it's funny yeah
21:11 <@Aranje> Sue knows well. Nobody could ever find music I actually loved
21:11 <@Aranje> But I can't describe what I want in music, it just has to feel right
21:22 <@Aranje> mmm

00:46 <@`> i'm so socially inept - i haven't really gotten out... much.
00:46 <@`> but online? i'm fine.
00:46 <@`> i think it comes from my deafness - online, no communication barrier at all.
00:46  * Aranje nods
00:46 <@Aranje> It may also just be part of personality
00:47 <@`> well no
00:47 <@`> i love going out and hanging with people

00:47 <@Aranje> Well if we ever hang out I'm bring a typing device and we'll work on my asl :>

00:48 <@Aranje> it doesn't move
00:48 <@`> (i've done that with sue, us sitting to each other, IRCing)
00:49 <@Aranje> In fact if you jiggle the power cord it overvolts the mobo and the laptop shoots itself in the face
00:49 <@Aranje> or at least I think that's what happens
00:49 <@Aranje> lol
00:51 <@`> damn
00:53 <@Aranje> Basically, if you twist the barrel it has a ~50% chance of turning off in the following 3/4 of a second

01:00 <@Aranje> very decent laptop

00:51 <@Aranje> I think it has something to do with minecraft, but that's the best I can do
00:52 <@Aranje> and that's not because there's anything about minecraft there -- there isn't -- but I remember bukkit being a server plugin or some shit

14:18 <@bikcmp> what would you do?
14:18 <@`> bikcmp: they have TTY termiology
14:18 <@bikcmp> i'm pretty much just saying what i want and then GA

16:59 <@`> not even at keyboard most of the time
16:59 <@`> gotta replace a couple pieces of furniture
17:01 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
17:01 <@bikcmp> `: where the hell is Sue lately 
17:02 <@`> one of two things:
17:02 <@`> he's cowering in the corner, totally freaking out
17:02 <@`> or
17:03 <@`> he's out trying to make $$ for the move.
17:03 <@`> i believe it's the latter.
17:04 <@bikcmp> `: cowering in the corner?
17:04 <@bikcmp> huh
17:04 <@bikcmp> why would he be doing that?
17:05 <@`> stress, lol
17:05 <@`> i mean, think about it - moving out of your hometown for the first time.
17:06 <@bikcmp> hm
17:06 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
17:06 <@bikcmp> `: tbh, 50 years ago i'd be cowering
17:06 <@bikcmp> but in today's age of the internet, tbh
17:06 <@bikcmp> i wouldn't care
17:06 <@bikcmp> video chat and all
17:06 <@bikcmp> very neat shit
17:06 <@`> still stressful, though.
17:07 <@`> i still have to replace a couple items of furniture in his room
17:07 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
17:07 <@`> = freeing up space.
17:07 <@bikcmp> `: how will you two talk?
17:07 <@`> irc. :P
17:07 <@bikcmp> lol
17:08 <@`> and i'll teach him sign.
17:08 <@bikcmp> `: i want to learn sign too.
17:08 <@bikcmp> `: i can finger spell, but like
17:08 <@bikcmp> i barely know any signs
17:08 <@bikcmp> and my hearing is getting worse by the day
17:09 <@`> yeah, you should start now
17:09 <@`> so it's less difficult later.
17:09 <@bikcmp> `: yes, that's why i'm trying to learn it really fast
17:09 <@bikcmp> `: while i can still hear decently
17:09 <@bikcmp> `: what are some decent resources for learning it?
17:10 <@`> just google around
17:10 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:10 <@`> i honestly don't know atm
17:10 <@bikcmp> `: i found some cool things at asl.gs and .ms
17:10 <@bikcmp> i can fingerspell pretty good now
17:10 <@`> a good book is...
17:10 <@`> A Basic Course in American Sign Language
17:11 <@bikcmp> `: is there an online version?
17:11 <@bikcmp> hm
17:11 <@bikcmp> sec
17:11 <@bikcmp> `: it's an older book, 1984?
17:12 <@bikcmp> still think it's decent?
17:12 <@`> it is.
17:12 <@bikcmp> let me see if i can find like, an ebook
17:12 <@`> you're forgetting the second edition.
17:13 <@`> which is '94, iirc
17:13 <@bikcmp> oh
17:13 <@bikcmp> i just looked it up on gplay
17:13 <@`> it was taught in my high school ASL classes
17:13 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:13 <@`> and with it, people can hold up a decent conversation with me
17:14 <@`> there ARE free apps that you can grab
17:14 <@`> Android apps, etc
17:14 <@bikcmp> `: eh?  find me a decent android app.  
17:14 <@bikcmp> i found one, but it was only fingerspelling.
17:15 <@bikcmp> and, that didn't help much.
17:15 <@bikcmp> i just made flash cards and abused asl.gs
17:15 <@bikcmp> lol
17:15 <@`> hmm
17:15 <@`> http://lifeprint.com/
17:15 <@bikcmp> `: i saw that
17:15 <@bikcmp> that's what i also use
17:15 <@`> there's a whole shit lot of .
17:15 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
17:16 <@bikcmp> `: i'm thinking about buying (it's 3 bucks) 'ASL dictionary'
17:16 <@bikcmp> off google play apps
17:18 <@`> http://www.aslpro.com/cgi-bin/aslpro/aslpro.cgi
17:18 <@bikcmp> ooh
17:18 <@bikcmp> `: that'll be useful
17:18 <@bikcmp> `: i also need to learn stuff like 'i', 'mine'
17:19 <@bikcmp> although
17:19 <@bikcmp> should i just spell 'i'
17:19 <@`> don't
17:19 <@bikcmp> as in, 'i want to go play'
17:19 <@`> just point to self
17:19 <@bikcmp> `: it's point at my chest, right?
17:19 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:19 <@`> like, literally point to yourself
17:19 <@`> yeah.
17:19 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:20 <@`> there's only very certain contexts that require the spelled "i"
17:20 <@bikcmp> `: huh
17:20 <@bikcmp> `: this doesn't even have 'want'
17:20 <@bikcmp> the site, that is
17:20 <@`> like if you're explictly satalking about "I" or whatever. :P
17:20 <@`> bikcmp: a lot of shit like that has holes in the dictionary
17:20 <@bikcmp> holes?
17:20 <@`> missing words, etc
17:20 <@bikcmp> oh
17:21 <@bikcmp> `: how can I say 'want'
17:21 <@bikcmp> i was going to look up "i want to play"
17:21 <@`> theres no complete, comprehensive dictionary online
17:21 <@bikcmp> or something like that
17:21 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
17:21 <@`> which does bug people.
17:21 <@bikcmp> `: there are no classes near me either
17:21 <@bikcmp> really sucks
17:21 <@bikcmp> the closest class is like, 30 miles away
17:21 <@bikcmp> lol
17:21 <@bikcmp> it'd take more time to get there than i'd be there for
17:22 <@`> ah yeah, that sucks.
17:22 <@bikcmp> `: another thing is i don't have anyone to practice with
17:22 <@bikcmp> which kinda makes me wonder why i'm learning asl
17:23 <@bikcmp> one day it'll be worth it when i seriously /can't/ hear anymore
17:23 <@`> yeah
17:23 <@`> :|
17:23 <@bikcmp> hm
17:23 <@bikcmp> `: so how would you say 'want'
17:23 <@bikcmp> this is missing a ton of nouns
17:24 <@`> http://www.signingsavvy.com/
17:25 <@bikcmp> `: i do like how there are tons of resources
17:25 <@bikcmp> that's a pretty cool thing.
17:25 <@bikcmp> bah
17:25 <@`> yeah.
17:25 <@bikcmp> `: it's giving me the 'i' letter again
17:26 <@`> that's traditional
17:26 <@`> go with it for now, i guess
17:26 <@bikcmp> hm
17:26 <@bikcmp> `: no, i know how to say i
17:26 <@bikcmp> but i'm just saying
17:26 <@bikcmp> `: ok, signingsavy is trying to sell me something
17:26 <@bikcmp> it won't let me look stuff up
17:27 <@`> its weird
17:27 <@`> i was able to load up "want"
17:27 <@bikcmp> eh?
17:27 <@bikcmp> k
17:27 <@`> they locked down search
17:27 <@bikcmp> `: i see what it's doing now
17:27 <@bikcmp> `: it just takes the first letter
17:27 <@bikcmp> gives me a list
17:27 <@`> so you have to browse.
17:27 <@`> it's bullshit, i know.
17:27 <@bikcmp> and then says if i want to jump right to it buy it
17:27 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:28 <@bikcmp> `: ctrl f ftw
17:28 <@bikcmp> `: http://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/PLAY/325/1

17:28 <@bikcmp> ah
17:28 <@bikcmp> `: hm
17:28 <@bikcmp> `: tbh this site might be worth the money
17:28 <@bikcmp> it's actually pretty decent
17:29 <@`> i agree.
17:29 <@bikcmp> `: the one thing that i like is the signs are pretty memorable
17:29 <@`> theres even an android and ios apps too
17:29 <@bikcmp> want is pretty easy to remember
17:29 <@bikcmp> `: yeah, there are like, a couple
17:29 <@bikcmp> `: go through them and tell me which one to get
17:29 <@bikcmp> i'm not sure
17:29 <@bikcmp> `: i know a couple are gtting horrible reviews on the market

14:43 <@bikcmp> `: i was hoping for some app on my phon
14:43 <@bikcmp> e
14:43 <@`> it's a hardware protocol, really
14:43 <@`> made over telephone
14:43 <@bikcmp> yeah
14:43 <@bikcmp> eh
14:44 <@bikcmp> iprelay is probably enough, tty is ollllllllllllld
14:44 <@`> it uses Baudot and Turbo code
14:44 <@bikcmp> `: what made me think of iprelay/tty is because I was on tmobile's live support chat
14:44 <@bikcmp> and they kept saying they couldn't help me online and wanted me to call
14:44 <@`> http://dgd.io/JWQM
14:44 <@`> bikcmp: never call any TTY line
14:45 <@bikcmp> `: i don't intend to, but why
14:45 <@`> bikcmp: tty needs to die.
14:45 <@`> simple as that.
14:45 <@bikcmp> yeah
14:45 <@bikcmp> `: i'm still trying to figure out what happens when someone calls me
14:45 <@bikcmp> lol
14:45 <@bikcmp> i really don't want to have /another/ app on my phone running

11:32 <@`> NETFLIX JUST GOT FUCKED OVER.
11:32 <@`> The National Association of the Deaf (“NAD”), the nation’s premier civil rights organization of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, won a major victory today when Judge Ponsor denied defendant Netflix’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings seeking dismissal of the case.  The District Court of Massachusetts is the first court in the country to hold that the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) applies to website-only businesses. The underlying lawsuit alleges that Netflix violates the ADA by failing to provide closed captioning on most of its “Watch Instantly” programming streamed on the Internet, thereby denying equal access to the deaf and hard of hearing community.

15:48 <@bikcmp> he quit
15:48 <@Aranje> okay
15:48 <@Aranje> why tell me?
15:48 -!- Irssi: #hh: Total of 10 nicks [6 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 4 normal]
15:48 <@bikcmp> Aranje: weren't you tlaking to him?
15:48 <@Aranje> I'm wasting my time anyway, he's not paying for support or so zach tells me
15:48 <@bikcmp> Aranje: he isn't, no
15:48 <@bikcmp> Aranje: he's pissing me off.
15:48 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i told him from the start i'd help him a /bit/ with the ircd.
15:48 <@Aranje> Cause he's dumb?
15:48 <@bikcmp> i ended up doing it for him, but then said 'you're on your fucking own' for atheme
15:49 <@bikcmp> Aranje: because he thinks he can make people do stuff for him and live off of that
15:49 <@Aranje> leecher :>
15:49 <@bikcmp> ikr
15:49 <@bikcmp> Aranje: anyway
15:49 <@Aranje> freeloader, older term
15:49 <@Aranje> lol
15:49 <@bikcmp> Aranje: basically, i say that if he wants support, either pay for it
15:49 <@bikcmp> or we lock him out of the vps and do a 'full managed' vps
15:49 <@bikcmp> like what was planned ^
15:49 <@bikcmp> i wasn't aware of that and i gave him root, sue didn't tell me
15:49 <@bikcmp> but jesus
15:49 <@bikcmp> he's fucking everything up
15:50 <@bikcmp> fix one thing he'll break another
15:50 <@`> so remove root.
15:50 <@`> and/or say that he modified the system too much that it's unsupported.
15:50 <@bikcmp> `: i'd like Sue's ok
15:50 <@interwarbls> you must be american
15:50 <@bikcmp> once sue gets settled i'd like to chat about this.
15:50 <@bikcmp> interwarbls: i am :(
15:51 <@interwarbls> you ask for permission to do everything
15:51 <@interwarbls> you want guidance for everything
15:51 <@interwarbls> you don't self start
15:51 <@interwarbls> at all
15:51 <@interwarbls> Sounds like usa highschool :D
15:51 <@bikcmp> s/highschool/listen to your higher ups school/
15:51 <@bikcmp> oh
15:51  * interwarbls doesn't mean it as an insult, it's a side effect of a broken educational system
15:51 <@bikcmp> and learn meaningless shit in the meantime*
15:51 <@interwarbls> fuck yeah you do
15:51 <@interwarbls> lol
15:51 <@interwarbls> Lots and lots of dates and names
15:51 <@bikcmp> when am i /ever/ going to need to know how to do algebra 2
15:52 <@interwarbls> all of which are useless
15:52 <@interwarbls> dude seriously?
15:52 <@interwarbls> don't even talk to me
15:52 <@bikcmp> interwarbls: at the least in my fields.
15:52 <@bikcmp> interwarbls: some people might need it, i won't.
15:52 <@bikcmp> `: once sue gets settled i'd like to decide what to do.
15:52 <@interwarbls> You should have a basic knowledge of math. Frankly that implies calculus to me, but most people think algebra is good enough.
15:53 <@interwarbls> algebra's good enough to add and average and things, not good enough to know why things work certain ways
15:53 <@interwarbls> which makes it useless to me
15:53 <@bikcmp> someone wants to buy a vps from hh, i think
15:53 <@bikcmp> so if someone joins, yeah.
15:54 <@bikcmp> any one else have access to the vps host and can make vpses?
15:54 <@interwarbls> kayy
15:54 <@bikcmp> i can, but i'm uploading a ton of files to a server and i don't want to reboot to do it
15:55 <@bikcmp> next time sue's online i'll go talk to him about removing root for managed vpses
15:55  * interwarbls only writes zee company site n.n
15:56 <@bikcmp> if he wants it managed, sure, kick him out. if not, we don't help him aside from stuff that we do.
15:56  * bikcmp writes the backends.
15:56 <@interwarbls> And I happen to have root on kanade and nagisa
15:56 <@`> and i'm the asshole who manages the simple hosting side
15:56 <@`> :D
15:56 <@interwarbls> but that's mostly grandfathered in
15:56 <@interwarbls> lol
15:56 <@interwarbls> nagisa = my bitch
15:57 <@bikcmp> makes sense.
15:57 <@bikcmp> NAGisa
15:57  * bikcmp ducks.
15:57 <@`> wolo
16:00 <@interwarbls> #YOLO
16:00 <@`> i hate that hash.
16:01 <@`> if i hear yolo, makes me want to slap somebody
16:01 <@bikcmp> I don't even get what yolo means
16:01 <@bikcmp> lol
16:01 <@`> you only live once.
16:01 <@`> which is one of my MOST hated phrases
16:01 <@`> ever.
16:01 <@bikcmp> `: oh. 
16:03 <@interwarbls> I've heard hash is pretty good
16:03 <@`> interwarbls: it is.
16:04 <@`> interwarbls: i prefer wax, though.
16:05 <@`> http://dgd.io/BAmM
16:06 <@interwarbls> lol you have a url shortener too
16:07 <@interwarbls> http://s.explodie.org/ <3
16:08 <@`> :P
16:08 <@`> paid service, though
16:08 <@`> via droplr.
16:08 <@interwarbls> oh, boring
16:10 <@`> yeah
16:10 <@`> i dont want just a urlshorterner
16:10 <@`> i also want a cyberlocker, as well
16:14  * interwarbls shrugs
16:15 <@interwarbls> winscp + nagisa = cyberlocker
16:31  * interwarbls is excite about utorrent 3.3+
16:31 <@interwarbls> Disk I/O system completely rewritten. Now multi-threaded and high performance. It will take advantage of multiple disks, perform better with even just one, and no one disk job can block everything (e.g slow network blocking local I/O, or allocating files)
16:31 <@interwarbls> Auto-labeling and per-label download directories (Preferences -> Label)
16:31 <@interwarbls> Search items in Advanced preferences
16:31 <@interwarbls> Paired device removal
16:47 <@interwarbls> DICKS DICKS DICKS
16:47 <@interwarbls> heh kim dotcom has a twitter now, and of course it's entertaining
17:25 <@`> interwarbls: nah, i want a single-command solution
17:25 <@`> i.e. in any browser
17:26 <@`> hit ALT-C
17:26 <@`> bam, url shortened and dropped into clipboard
17:26 <@Aranje> single command for what
17:26 <@`> drag any file onto the app in the menubar, uploaded, url shortened, dropped into clipboard
17:26 <@Aranje> oh
17:26 <@Aranje> god I hate shit like that
17:27 <@`> i love that shit.
17:27 <@Aranje> I fucking hate it
17:27 <@`> i.e. i shorten whatever shit im looking at
17:27 <@Aranje> I don't like that sort of `automation`
17:27 <@`> and throw it out
17:27 <@`> Aranje: suck it. it's happening.
17:27 <@Aranje> It doesn't give me a choice 
17:27 <@Aranje> to choose what I want kept out of the cloud, or what links I want given to some third party
17:28 <@Aranje> The most automated thing I've got is the bookmarklet for shortening pages/links I'm looking at
17:28 <@Aranje> I'm happy with that
17:29 <@Aranje> I liked dropbox, too
17:29 <@Aranje> but eh, it isn't my server
17:30 <@Aranje> and sparkleshare didn't work well
17:31 <@Aranje> It had problems when I tried to add 45k files
17:31 <@Aranje> (It actually ignored most of them and never sync'd them)
17:33 <@Aranje> Iunno, I don't like most of the new shit lol
17:33 <@bikcmp> eh
17:33 <@bikcmp> i hate db
17:33 <@bikcmp> i like google drive because I think google has a sense of, hm
17:34 <@bikcmp> pride?
17:35  * Aranje shrugs
17:35 <@Aranje> I wasn't in love with gdrive either
17:35 <@bikcmp> Aranje: why?
17:35 <@bikcmp> i personally love gdrive.
17:35 <@bikcmp> very cheap storage.
17:36 <@bikcmp> dead easy ui.
17:36 <@Aranje> It's set up for documents and things, not what I want to store there
17:36 <@Aranje> I'm trying to find a service for source code backup, basically
17:36 <@Aranje> that's what I use it for
17:36 <@Aranje> and to store an encrypted copy of my bitcoin wallet for backup purposes
17:37 <@Aranje> No service has yet to do those things the way I want them to
17:37  * Aranje keeps waiting for said service
17:39 <@Aranje> The thing is, I don't want `good enough`
17:39 <@Aranje> I want perfect
17:39 <@Aranje> gdrive, dropbox are `good enough`
17:39 <@Aranje> though only dropbox is really set up to do what I want to with it
17:39 <@Aranje> but there are shitty arbitrary size limits there and bandwidth limits as well
17:41 <@Aranje> One day I want something where I can run a monitor process on nagisa that tracks changes in my /mirror/ directory
17:41 <@Aranje> that will then back up all files placed there on some sort of `cloud backup`
17:41 <@Aranje> with a self-hosted webui
17:41 <@Aranje> or a company-hosted backup one
17:41 <@Aranje> (preferably both
17:41 <@Aranje> )
18:02 <@`> yeah
18:02 <@`> that's what i want, pretty much
18:02 <@`> a selfhosted solution.
18:03 <@`> but alas, there aren't such a thing for now.
18:15 <@Aranje> I could do it myself
18:15 <@Aranje> In fact, I probably should
18:15 <@Aranje> It'd take me 6 hours or so.
18:15 <@`> be my guest
18:15 <@Aranje> (to do it the way I want)
18:15 <@Aranje> but then I need a web interface
18:15 <@Aranje> that will take longer
18:15 <@`> yep.
18:16 <@Aranje> It'd be easy to just punt it onto a tahoe-lafs grid, but the one I'm using does not have file expiration yet
18:16 <@Aranje> Which means I can't delete old backups (I only want to keep say 3 months or 6 months worth)
18:39 -!- interwarbls [interwarbl@72-843-365-348.dhcp.wtvl.ca.charter.com] has quit []
20:09 <@Aranje> so yeah
20:09 <@Aranje> I think my router/modem combo box is shit
20:09 <@Aranje> torrents are off and I'm no longer getting 3% packet loss
20:09 <@Aranje> fuckers
20:10 <@Aranje> likely it just doesn't want to deal with 1600 torrents and all the tracker announces that imploes
20:10 <@Aranje> implies*
20:48 <@Sue> `
20:49 <@Sue> `: broping
20:50 <@Aranje> that one isn't formatted right
20:55 <@Aranje> Sue:) You'd play something like Vindictus. Is it any good?
20:56 <@Sue> it was *okay* but is wasn't good
20:57 <@Aranje> The gameplay videos looked awesome but repetitive
20:57 <@Aranje> And not even grinding repetitive
21:41 <@`>  /kill Sue broping
21:41 <@`> ;)
21:42 <@Sue> `: there you are
21:42 <@Sue> so dickface mcgee is going to be late on his payment, and i'm gonna have to migrate bikcmp and joey away from that server
21:43 <@Sue> that's why i keep trying to say dude, let me buy you ram for the i7
21:44 <@bikcmp> Sue: dickface mcgee?
21:44 <@bikcmp> aka shadow?
21:44 <@bikcmp> Sue: wait, 108.170.18.146 is going down?
21:45 <@Sue> it's not going down
21:46 <@Sue> well
21:46 <@Sue> the host box is because nobody is fucking paying
21:47 <@Sue> "well shut them off" is all fine and dandy but that makes me unable to pay for the server
21:47 <@bikcmp> Sue: do it, force them to pay.
21:47 <@bikcmp> you're too nice.
21:47 <@Sue> they won't
21:47 <@Sue> then i'll lose that box
21:47 <@bikcmp> Sue: then kill their vpses
21:47 <@bikcmp> suspend their vpses until they pay.
21:47 <@Sue> you don't understand
21:47 <@Sue> the host box will be gone
21:47 <@bikcmp> i might not understand the entire situation
21:47 <@Sue> if they don't pay
21:47 <@bikcmp> Sue: why?
21:48 <@Sue> because i don't have enough pocket money to pay for it
21:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: yes, i know that much, so make it so they have a reason to pa
21:48 <@bikcmp> y
21:48 <@bikcmp> atm they're freeriding you.
21:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: that, or get shadow to pay in advance
21:48 <@Sue> in any case, i lost another customer so the host node is going away anyway
21:48 <@bikcmp> and hope that we could recover it.
21:48 <@Sue> so i'm moving you somewhere else
21:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: ah
21:48 <@bikcmp> Sue: will files stay intact?
21:48 <@Sue> yeah
21:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: i want to keep a backup jic
21:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: when will this happen?
21:49 <@Sue> 26th
21:49 <@bikcmp> whenever bikcmp gives you the ok?
21:49 <@bikcmp> k
21:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: actually
21:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: know what
21:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: can you do me a favor?
21:49 <@Sue> what
21:49 <@bikcmp> Sue: set up the vps now on the new node.
21:49 <@bikcmp> set it up as a new vps, debian 6
21:49 <@Sue> there's a problem
21:49 <@bikcmp> i'll manually transfer.
21:49 <@bikcmp> yeah?
21:49 <@Sue> i don't have a new node
21:49 <@bikcmp> oh
21:49 <@bikcmp> so wait
21:49 <@bikcmp> you won't have it until this is gone?
21:49 <@bikcmp> there'll be no overlap period?
21:49 <@Sue> i'm trying to convince ` here to let me buy ram
21:49 <@Sue> for his nice server
21:50 <@Sue> so i can libvirt move you
21:50 <@bikcmp> hm
21:50 <@bikcmp> Sue: i actually have a couple of servers at home.
21:50 <@bikcmp> like, real servers.
21:50 <@Sue> but what kind of line are they on
21:50 <@bikcmp> 20/5.
21:50 <@Sue> ` has 35/35
21:50 <@bikcmp> n
21:50 <@bikcmp> plus, they suck up power like ` sucks up old men for money
21:50 <@Sue> LOL
21:51 <@bikcmp> `: don't deny don't deny
21:51 <@Sue> that's why i'm trying to migrate you to `'s house
21:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: pay shipping and i'll send you one
21:51 <@Sue> does it have VM extensions?
21:51 <@bikcmp> no
21:51 <@bikcmp> Sue: they're old, sadly.
21:51 <@Sue> won't work
21:51 <@Sue> hrmm
21:51 <@Sue> there is
21:51 <@bikcmp> they're very old.

21:54 <@bikcmp> Sue: does he need to be in person or online?
21:54 <@Sue> Aranje: i move to LA tomorrow
21:54 <@Aranje> I heard

21:55 <@Aranje> If not, 'scool
21:55 <@Sue> grandparents are driving
21:55 <@bikcmp> Sue: i know a pretty lot about administrating servers. i'm not too sure about libvirt, but i could figure it out with a bit of help
21:55 <@bikcmp> the main problem is i have no idea how you configured networking
21:55 <@bikcmp> aside from that i'm fine with libvirt
21:55 <@Sue> i have no clue how i configured networking
21:55  * Aranje screams documentation
21:55 <@bikcmp> Sue: i could try.
21:55 <@bikcmp> Sue: i /think/ i know how you did it
21:55 <@bikcmp> but i've never done it.
21:55 <@Sue> sunday, we'll have another meeting
21:56 <@bikcmp> Sue: where will it be?

22:07 <@`> and all of them are full.
22:08  * Aranje grins
22:08 <@Aranje> DO ALL THE THINGS
22:10 <@Sue> wat
22:10 <@Sue> i'm not asking you to give it
22:11 <@Sue> i'm asking if i can upgrade it and put libvirt on it
22:11 <@Sue> using debian
22:11 <@Sue> it's a debian box, right?
22:11 <@Sue> basically, i'm asking for a regular user in the libvirt group
22:11 <@Sue> with libvirt and kvm installed

19:57 <@Aranje> I lump everything down there into LA
19:57 <@Aranje> because it's all too-many-people-per-square-mile for me
19:58 <@`> bikcmp: my mom and i
19:58 <@Aranje> also woot. Dropping dht from utorrent fixed my packet loss problems :>
20:00 <@Aranje> which means 450kbps upload AND gaming/webbrowsing at the same time
20:00 <@Aranje> fuck year
20:00 <@`> no way
20:00 <@`> not even texting him gets any response
20:00 <@`> so i'm willing to bet his phone's dead ._.
20:00 <@Aranje> ...welcome to sue?
20:01 <@`> last fix on him was san dimas, 40 minutes ago
20:01 <@`> he should be around colton.
20:02 <@bikcmp> `: ahh
20:08 <@`> still no update nor text from him
20:09 <@`> so probability is high that his phone's dead.
20:10 <@bikcmp> `: no charger ftl
20:11 <@Aranje> lol
20:11 <@Aranje> He had a car charger
20:11 <@Aranje> that's funky
20:12 <@`> lol
20:12 <@`> 51 minutes now
20:12 <@`> still nada.
20:12 <@bikcmp> `: he's probably in a dead zone
20:12 <@bikcmp> `: i would say a joke, but like
20:12 <@bikcmp> i'm not sure if you're the person who'd, uh, not like the humor
20:16 <@`> nope
20:16 <@`> i *know* he'll have service all the way to L.A.
20:16 <@`> i know, because i traveled up to his place twice
20:17 <@bikcmp> hm
20:17 <@`> once, really, up and then down
20:17 <@bikcmp> `: i'm sure he's fine
20:17 <@`> i know
20:17 <@bikcmp> `: he probably fell asleep
20:17 <@bikcmp> lol
20:17 <@bikcmp> entry = config_find_entry(me.config->entries, "autojoin");
20:17 <@bikcmp> er.
20:17 <@`> i just hate not knowing:
20:17 <@Aranje> battery died > vastly more likely
20:17 <@bikcmp> `: don't we all
20:17 <@`> lest he 'sneak' up behind me
20:17 <@`> lol
20:17 <@bikcmp> oh
20:17 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
20:17 <@Aranje> battery died fits with personality
20:18 <@Aranje> >_>
20:18 <@`> yup
20:18 <@bikcmp> `: be prepared for suprise buttsecks, knowing sue.
20:18 <@bikcmp> <.<
20:18 <@`> lol

20:18 <@bikcmp> you'd be suprised
20:18 <@bikcmp> he could be one of those people on 'how to catch a preditor'
20:18 <@`> pft, i'm older than he is
20:18 <@Aranje> wat
20:19 <@Aranje> bikcmp:) You're silly.

20:23 <@bikcmp> `: which space?
20:24 <@Aranje> I'm super excited
20:25 <@Aranje> I canceled my cnet account and put as the reason that it was because they're stopping the text version of their emails soon
20:25 <@Aranje> I got an actual reply from someone explaining why they were doing it
20:25 <@bikcmp> lol
20:25 <@Aranje> Fucking awesome.
20:25 <@bikcmp> damn
20:25 <@bikcmp> Aranje: that's nice.

20:26 <@bikcmp> html2text.py
20:26 <@bikcmp> <.<
20:26 <@Aranje> Nah
20:26 <@Aranje> My client already blocks all external resources
20:26 <@bikcmp> lol
20:26 <@Aranje> But if you can select a text version, it's often formatted decently instead of just stripping all the html out or some stupid thing
20:49 <@bikcmp> `: news?
20:51 <@`> giving him the tour.
20:52 <@bikcmp> `: oh, he arrived?

01:00 <@bikcmp> `: can you fetch sue?
01:03 < rih> this was almost 12 hours ago...
01:03 < rih> sue passed out for long itme i guess
01:03 < rih> http://s16.postimage.org/cwuucnc6d/sue_will_fix_shit.jpg
01:03 <@bikcmp> rih: holy shit you have a /ton/ of shit on your computer
01:03 <@bikcmp> lol
01:05 < rih> meh
01:05 < rih> alienware can handle tons of shit xD
01:06 < rih> but yh i agree
01:07 <@Sue> rih, not much i can do about the tekkit server atm
01:07 < rih> why ?
01:08 <@Sue> i'm trying to figure how i can delete trav's area
01:08 <@Sue> because it crashes pretty much instantly
01:08 < rih> ./remove items radius
01:08 < rih> u can use
01:08 < rih> it from console for all server mby
01:08 < rih> idk
01:09 < rih> btw
01:09 < rih> im there
01:09 < rih> so if i login it crashes instant too
01:09 < rih> :(
01:10 < rih> i had similar problem but rio fixed it form trubs acc
01:10 < rih> 10k enities in 20 blocks xD
01:14 <@Sue> eek
01:14 < rih> ?
01:15 <@Sue> yeah, it crashes instantly on map load
01:15 < rih> server is up for me
01:15 <@Sue> really?
01:15 < rih> 5698 ms xD
01:15 <@Sue> i can't even connect
01:15 < rih> me too
01:15 < rih> i ran out of mem
01:15 < rih> is that worth the risk to remove all item enities form console ?
01:18 < rih> if you can
01:18 < rih> ./remove 	<type> <radius> 
01:18 < rih> ingame
01:18 < rih> idk if works form console
01:18 < rih> when i had overloaded chunk i mc edited it out and generated new one
01:19 < rih> but trav shoudnt loose hi /awesome/ factory
01:22 < rih> Sue
01:22 < rih> U there ?
01:22 < rih> i ahve idea
01:22 < rih> it crashes instantly because world anchors load the chunk
01:23 < rih> if u tmep disable them the chunk wont load and you should be able to join...
01:23 < rih> temp*
01:30 < rih> Sooo nobody will do nothing ? xD

15:00 <@bikcmp> do those and tell me when they're done
15:00 <@bikcmp> i'll throw you an admin account on hardestyhosting.com, too
15:00 <@Aranje> suck it https://webmail.hardestyhosting.com/
15:00 <@Aranje> we already have mail
15:00 <@bikcmp> Aranje: we need this for gapps ;p
15:00 <@Aranje> what are those lines then
15:00 <@bikcmp> add those as mx records
15:00 <@bikcmp> for @.
15:00 <@Aranje> oh, okay
15:01 <@bikcmp> remove all existing mx, i think you have one
15:01 <@bikcmp> then put those in.
15:01 <@bikcmp> i'll throw you an admin account, too
15:01 <@Aranje> Yeah but we have mail already
15:01 <@bikcmp> Aranje: i love google.
15:01 <@bikcmp> Aranje: yeah, but tbh
15:01 <@bikcmp> we're a small team
15:01 <@bikcmp> < 10 people
15:01 <@bikcmp> so gapps would fit us perfectly
15:01 <@Aranje> ask sue first
15:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: get yo' buns over here.
15:01 <@Aranje> He set up mail, and I won't change mail without his auth
15:01 <@bikcmp> Sue: in all seriousness, do you want to use google apps for mail?
15:01 <@bikcmp> Aranje: sure
15:01 <@Aranje> It's... his thing :P
15:02 <@bikcmp> Aranje: we have access to drive, too and all that
15:02 <@Aranje> yep
15:02  * Aranje doesn't like drive
15:02 <@bikcmp> eh?
15:02 <@bikcmp> i <3 it

15:02 <@bikcmp> <.<
15:02 <@Aranje> ass kisser
15:02 <@bikcmp> Sue: want to use google apps for our mail and all that shit?
15:02 <@Sue> no
15:02 <@Sue> we have a mail server
15:02  * Aranje laughs
15:02 <@Sue> i've said this repeatedly
15:02  * bikcmp shrugs
15:02 <@bikcmp> k
15:03 <@bikcmp> Sue: i don't recall, but ok
15:03 <@bikcmp> Sue: when we were doing the vpscontrol.hh thing, i signed up for gapps. you don't have to use any of it, but it has some cool things
15:04 <@bikcmp> do you want to use /any/ of it?
15:04 <@Sue> i dunno
15:05 <@bikcmp> Sue: want an account on it?
15:05 <@bikcmp> Aranje too
15:06 <@Aranje> I want no such thing
15:06 <@Aranje> I believe I have a jacob@hh from ages ago
15:06 <@bikcmp> no, not for email
15:06 <@Aranje> hopefully forwarded to some other email, but I don't know 
15:06 <@Aranje> account for what
15:06 <@Aranje> why do I want an account on yet another service
15:07 <@Aranje> what is it, why do I want one
15:07 <@bikcmp> gapps.  you don't seem to be a fan of gapps though ;p
15:07 <@bikcmp> Aranje: so you can easily seperate everything for hh
15:07 <@bikcmp> and put it in it's own account
15:07 <@bikcmp> rather than your personal acc
15:07 <@Aranje> You mean splinter my accounts so I have yet another account I will never use?
15:08 <@Aranje> I already have enough issues keeping a proper private email and my well-known public one
15:08 <@Aranje> I do not intend to complicate that further
15:08 <@bikcmp> Aranje: if you say so
15:09 <@Aranje> Your shitty attempts at guilt tripping don't work on me
15:09 <@Sue> lol
15:09  * bikcmp ... wtf
15:09 <@bikcmp> Aranje: you just need to say no
15:09 <@bikcmp> that's it
15:09 <@bikcmp> lol
15:10 <@Aranje> I believe I did, by my count at least twice
15:10 <@bikcmp> sure
15:11  * Aranje laughs
15:11 <@Aranje> Sue knows :)
15:12 <@Sue> he spent like a week removing himself from google listing
15:12 <@Sue> s
15:12 <@bikcmp> lol
15:12 <@bikcmp> that isn't how you do it
15:13 <@bikcmp> you sign up for a billion accounts
15:13 <@bikcmp> that's how you remove yourself
15:13 <@bikcmp> flood google with tons of info
15:13 <@Aranje> Nope!
15:13 <@bikcmp> that's how i do it ;p
15:13 <@Aranje> Every 6 months I dox myself and remove everything I don't want
15:13 <@bikcmp> nice
15:13 <@bikcmp> Aranje: how do you remove it?
15:14 <@Aranje> I delete the accounts, send takedown requests
15:14 <@bikcmp> what kind of takedown requests?
15:14 <@Aranje> dmca
15:14 <@bikcmp> the polite kind ones, or dmca
15:14 <@bikcmp> ah
15:14 <@Aranje> amoung other things
15:14 <@Aranje> I'm nice if I can be
15:14 <@Aranje> some places have forms :3
15:14 <@Aranje> clickbutton -> 24hourgone
15:15 <@bikcmp> eh
15:15 <@bikcmp> google usually takes like
15:15 <@bikcmp> a week for it to be removed.
15:15 <@Aranje> Oh, that's much faster than it used to be
15:15 <@Aranje> The reason I do it every 6 months was because that's how long it takes to drop out
15:16 <@bikcmp> to drop out?
15:16 <@Aranje> But the thing you're missing is this: Lots of sites scrape content, so that shit shows up too
15:16 <@Aranje> Might take a week to get the site out of google, but those other scrape sites aren't so fast
15:16 <@Aranje> they have to rescrape with the new info, then drop /those/ out of google
15:16 <@Aranje> ad nauseum
15:17 <@Aranje> 6 months seems to be often enough but not too often
15:17 <@Aranje> I'm uh
15:17 <@Aranje> thorough.
15:17 <@Aranje> It's about time I do that, actually
15:17 <@Aranje> Perhaps tonight
15:18 <@Aranje> I should go buy some brandy or rum, that always makes scorched earth more fun

13:53 <@bikcmp> for some stuff java isn't that bad
13:53 <@Aranje> data processing in java was nice
13:54 <@Aranje> write some generic code and it magically handles all the things for you
14:12 < `_> why the fuck am i `_

14:13 <@Aranje> I can't get my tahoe-lafs grid to take my new copy of aranjepack :(
14:13  * Aranje sad face
14:14 <@`> also, bikcmp: it's usually 6667 nonssl, 6697 ssl
14:14 <@Aranje> oh D:
14:14 <@Aranje> most of the fucking
14:14 <@Aranje> jesus
14:14 <@`> bikcmp: then 8067 backup nonssl; 8097 backup ssl
14:14 <@Aranje> over half of the net is disconnected or down
14:14 <@Aranje> 7000 is ssl too
14:14 <@Aranje> but that's old, from efnet and so
14:15 <@Aranje> I want mirror to be on its own server
14:15 <@Aranje> :>
14:15  * Aranje builds said server
14:15 <@Aranje> varnish cache in front of nginx?
14:15 <@Aranje> fuck yeah!
14:15 <@Aranje> here varnish, have 3g of ram
14:16 <@`> i cant even do /map
14:16 <@`> so i cant see whatever servers thats connected
14:16 <@Aranje> actually it'd be 3.75g of ram
14:16  * ` shrugs
14:16 <@`> if only bikcmp would actually give me +N
14:17 <@`> :P
14:17 <@Aranje> cause the OS and nginx will use 9.7 megs
14:17 <@Aranje> obsd + nginx + varnish
14:17 <@Aranje> sounds fucking le-git.
14:18 <@`> i redid my server here at home
14:18 <@`> with debian testing + nginx + php-fpm
14:18 <@Aranje> mmhmm
14:18 <@Aranje> that's my safe build
14:18 <@Aranje> I could do it asleep
14:18 <@`> i'm also now perpetually VPN'd
14:19 <@`> since i've killed all rules for mosh and ssh facing the internet
14:19  * ` pets my Cisco ASA
14:20 <@Aranje> lol
14:20 <@Aranje> I have a 8port gbit dumb switch that all my gbit capable things plug to
14:20 <@Aranje> and my router is gbit now, iirc
14:20 <@Aranje> cause it's all fancy and wifi N and ipv6
14:20 <@`> heh
14:21 <@`> i just use a overpowered box running pfsense
14:21 <@Aranje> hah
14:21 <@Aranje> according to the lights on my switch, router's pumping gbit
14:21 <@Aranje> <3
14:21 <@`> which is in turn using a tunnel from hurricane electric
14:21 <@Aranje> mmm
14:21 <@`> it's directly connected to a 5-port gbit switch
14:21 <@Aranje> my laptop is the only one with ipv6 atm, cause it has proper support for all transition tech
14:21 <@Aranje> being linux and all
14:22 <@Aranje> lol
14:22 <@`> i just shoved my network entirely onto ipv6
14:22 <@Aranje> isp doesn't carry it here
14:22 <@`> once things dhcp-lease-renewed
14:22 <@`> bam, ipv6
14:22 <@`> including sue's shitty windows install
14:22 <@Aranje> His stuff is horrible isn't it?
14:22 <@Aranje> lmao
14:22 <@`> (i will always hate on windows)
14:22 <@`> (especially msft)

14:23 <@`> but yeah.

14:23 <@bikcmp> yeah
14:23 <@bikcmp> and?
14:23 <@bikcmp> lol
14:24 <@Aranje> My old local irc net (for testing shit) was ssl only
14:24 <@bikcmp> ahh
14:24 <@bikcmp> Aranje: we have 6697 ssl too
14:24 <@Aranje> I had 6667 and 6697 and 7000 and 9999
14:25 <@Aranje> last three should be ssl depending on where you started irc'ing

14:51 <@Aranje> awesome
14:52 <@Aranje> DOMContentLoaded is at 300ms for aranjepack page
14:52 <@Aranje> onload fires at 680ms though
14:52 <@Aranje> cause twitter takes forever
14:52 <@Aranje> and the bitcoin donate image is huge
14:52 <@Aranje> and nagisa is not very fast at handing out data
14:53 <@Aranje> oh nvm, it's the paypal donate button
14:53  * Aranje rehosted it
14:56 <@Aranje> this is the shit I do when I'm bored
14:56 <@Aranje> >_>
14:56 <@Aranje> or bitch about sites that host their own jquery, or check people's page dependency headers to see if they've got proper cache headers on em
15:03 <@Aranje> interesting
15:03 <@Aranje> I use query on a few pages
15:03 <@Aranje> turns out jquery's cdn is faster than the cloudflare one
15:03 <@Aranje> lulz
15:03 <@Aranje> 14ms vs 55
15:14 <@Aranje> so uh
15:14 <@Aranje> microsoft's javascript cdn is really fast
15:15 <@Aranje> so jquery uses edgecast
15:15 <@Aranje> and ms's cdn is their own
15:16 <@Aranje> huh
15:16 <@Aranje> it's bing
15:16 <@Aranje> crazy
15:16 <@Aranje> shit's fast as fuck though
15:16 <@Aranje> 12ms average
15:16 <@Aranje> slight faster than edgecast

16:25 <@bikcmp> Aranje: are you sure that isn't in 2038?
16:25 <@Aranje> Well since it's dated this morning
16:26 <@Aranje> I'd guess not
16:26 <@bikcmp> because of the int32.
16:26 <@Aranje> it has nothing to do with that

14:43 < interwarbls> `: punch zach for me
14:44 < interwarbls> `: Tell him to figure out what happened to nagisa. It's not even timing out. It looks like either their router is dead or the IP flat out changed.
14:44 < interwarbls> oh, and now it's back!
14:44 < interwarbls> For no reason 
14:45 < interwarbls> :|
14:45 <@`> when i went out there
14:45 <@`> he was already working on it
14:45 < interwarbls> Haha awesome
14:45 < interwarbls> He got my text then, or noticed
14:45 < interwarbls> :>
14:48 <@`> power outage, apparently
14:49 <@`> nope
14:49 <@`> apparently
14:49 <@`> nagisa was donged by out-of-swap-space errors
14:50 <@`> AKA some asshole ran something that chomped up all of the system RAM
14:58 < interwarbls> wat
14:58 < interwarbls> does he know what it was?
14:58 <@`> not yet
14:58 < interwarbls> reading logs?
14:59 <@`> no, he's talking to a potential client
14:59 <@`> hold on
14:59 < interwarbls> mmm :>
15:08 < interwarbls> so this is how I torrent: http://mirror.explodie.org/transfer-july-1-2012.png
15:11 <@`> pssh.
15:11 <@`> for the past week: http://dgd.io/djaY
15:15  * ` sets up bandwidthd properly.
15:16  * ` sets reporting for only 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24
15:17 <@`> gah.
15:17 <@`> it's not generating graphs for some reason
15:29 <@`> it now reports the subnets properly
15:29 <@`> but no graphs
15:29 <@`> but im updating my router, though.
15:31 <@`> sigh.
15:31 <@`> i have to let WHMCS' license lapse for a bit.
15:32 <@`> i cant afford it.
15:46 < interwarbls> okay
15:47 < interwarbls> dunno what that is :D
15:47 < interwarbls> also AWESOME
15:47 <@`> what?
15:47 <@`> oh the graph
15:47 <@`> lol
15:47 < interwarbls> almost done writing all my own social-media buttons
15:47 < interwarbls> nope not the graph
15:49 < interwarbls> trynna make this bitch load semi-instantly: http://explodie.org/aranjepack.html
15:49 < interwarbls> need a place to host fucking aranjepack though
15:49 < interwarbls> I can't get my tahoe-lafs grid to take my files :|
15:49 < interwarbls> Mainly because half the grid is down
15:49 < interwarbls> lol
15:50 < interwarbls> the next thing will be to rewrite the bit of js that does tabs the for my site to not use any javascript libraries
15:51 < interwarbls> and then I'm going to shotgun all the css into one file, and put it on mirror
15:51 < interwarbls> then mirror is going to be put on its own server
15:52 < interwarbls> which eventually will be a geo-dns cdn-ish setup
15:52 < interwarbls> :>
15:53 < interwarbls> kinda wish I could get a job doing pageload optimization
15:53 < interwarbls> I'm uh
15:53 < interwarbls> quite good at it.
15:54 < interwarbls> and mirror has been replicated onto a 1u at my house
15:54 < interwarbls> if I can find someone to host it for free on a faster line, that will be mirror
15:55 < interwarbls> the next bit of that is to have a cronjob scp-sync mirror from nagisa to this 1u here every 10 minutes
15:55 < interwarbls> :>
15:56 < interwarbls> or mayhaps I'll make something to run on nagisa that pushes changes instead
15:56 < interwarbls> I dunno yet which is better, push or pull updates
15:56 < interwarbls> push will be much more efficient
15:58 < interwarbls> and with push I could set up a queue on nagisa so that if I'm shitting files onto nagisa it'll just queue them instead of trying to blow everything
15:58 < interwarbls> humbum
16:16 <@`> i love the fact that i have to be perpetually VPN'd
16:17 <@`> to maintain connections to my servers (ssh/mosh is locked down to the internal network only (including VPN clients))
16:17 <@`> so
16:17 <@`> i have to VPN to get back onto irc
16:17 <@`> :P
17:08 < interwarbls> lol
17:09 < interwarbls> lol
17:25 <@`> i'm pretty locked down
17:25 <@`> and i dont think that's enough
17:25 <@`> i still need to lock things down further.
17:26 <@`> like give DONGS his VLAN with its own /24
17:26 <@`> etc etc
17:52 <@bikcmp> `: hey
17:52 <@bikcmp> `: sup
18:12 <@bikcmp> /3/14
18:38 < interwarbls> `: lol. Sounds like you're armoring your network against the wrong adversary
18:43 < interwarbls> so this is a very informative article, if you pay less attention to what's being said and more attention to the bits of info about SSD production thrown into sentences: http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/06/why-ssds-cost-half-of-what-they-did-in-2011/
18:52 <@`> well
18:52 <@`> i'm mostly armoring against external AND internal threats.
18:52 <@`> :]
18:54 < interwarbls> Yeah okay
18:55 < interwarbls> only thing I'd do is put servers on their own vlan just in case, but likely I wouldn't even do that
18:58  * interwarbls goes to compile unbound on the 1u for local network caching dns awesomeness
19:07 < interwarbls> om nom nom
19:07 < interwarbls> allow 192.0.0.0/8
19:07 < interwarbls> bah
19:07 < interwarbls> fucking unbound needs gmake which... needs perl?
19:08 < interwarbls> :/
19:08  * interwarbls waits while perl compiles from source
19:09 <@`> meh.
19:10 <@`> i need a cryptokey

16:03 <@`> i'm hoping the MEIDs are clean
16:03 <@bikcmp> `: isn't it esns?
16:03 <@bikcmp> for cdma?
16:03 <@`> nope
16:03 <@`> it's MEID now
16:03 <@`> really
16:03 <@`> MEID and ESN is the same thing
16:03 <@`> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_equipment_identifier
16:04 <@`> The MEID was created to replace ESNs, whose virgin form was exhausted in November 2008.
16:04 <@bikcmp> ahhh
16:04 <@bikcmp> i get it
16:04 <@bikcmp> `: the A000000AJHSDJAHSDLKJAHSDKAHISD
16:04 <@bikcmp> right?
16:04 <@`> yeah.
16:04 <@bikcmp> hex/dec?
16:04 <@bikcmp> nice
16:04 <@bikcmp> `: i love my galaxy nexus.
16:04 <@bikcmp> best phone evr.
16:05 <@`> :P
16:05 <@`> i'm sorta worried
16:05 <@`> i lost my phone in the house
16:05 <@bikcmp> you saw the injunction?
16:05 <@`> i still cant find it
16:05 <@bikcmp> oh
16:05 <@`> D:
16:05 <@bikcmp> `: sue might have stolen it
16:05 <@`> i doubt it
16:05 <@bikcmp> check his clothes
16:05 <@bikcmp> :P
16:05 <@`> he knows i'm locked out of some stuff without it
16:05 <@`> (i use my phone as a 2-factor auth)
16:05 <@bikcmp> yeah
16:05 <@`> so i'm kinda FFFFFFFFFF
16:06 <@bikcmp> that sucks
16:06 <@`> and really hoping i'll find it
16:06 <@bikcmp> `: what carrier?
16:06 <@bikcmp> metro?
16:06 <@bikcmp> `: did it have sound on?
16:06 <@bikcmp> lol
16:06 <@bikcmp> (ask sue)
16:06 <@`> last known location given off its GPS was in the immediate vicinity of me
16:06 <@`> i did ask him
16:06 <@`> no luck
16:06 <@bikcmp> try calling it
16:06 <@bikcmp> and have sue hear forit
16:07 <@`> its dead now.
16:07 <@`> so, er, yeah
16:07 <@`> i have it set to email me immediately once it gets online
16:07 <@`> anywhere
16:07 <@`> so if it mysteriously gets online, i know its stolen
16:08 <@`> heres the screenshot
16:08 <@`> http://dgd.io/YLNK
16:08 <@`> and yes, i like dgd.io - because i own it
16:12 <@`> it also happens to be a nigger
16:12 <@`> so it can get lost in my mountains of nigger stuff
16:12 <@`> (i own quite a few black items)
16:13 <@bikcmp> `: you own dgd.io?
16:13 <@bikcmp> nice
16:14 <@`> go to http://dgd.io/
16:14 <@`> :P
16:15 <@bikcmp> i saw ;p
16:15 <@bikcmp> `: how do you generate the URLS
16:15 <@bikcmp> like, /BLEH
16:15 <@bikcmp> `: my urls tend to be /giant/
16:15 <@bikcmp> lol
16:16 <@bikcmp> it doesn't help that i need to propgate it to a lot of servers
16:16 <@bikcmp> ie, must be /absolutely/ unique
16:17 <@`> heh
16:17 <@`> i actually use a service
16:17 <@`> http://droplr.com/pro
16:17 <@`> it's not just a url shortener
16:17 <@`> but also an cyberlocker.
16:18 <@bikcmp> `: example.
16:18 <@bikcmp> `: http://accounts.irondust.net/VerifyEmail?userid=ahNzfmlyb25kdXN0LWFjY291bnRzcgwLEgVVc2VycxjLZQw&confirm=1b7fcc99-cf2f-48cc-84c1-d03463dc3ee1
16:18 <@bikcmp> lol
16:18 <@`> eww.
16:18 <@`> yeah.
16:18 <@`> what would be awesome
16:18 <@`> is if you created a self-hosted cyberlocker
16:19 <@bikcmp> self hosted?
16:19 <@`> with a web iface and all.
16:19 <@`> yes.
16:19 <@`> i dont want to rely on a external service eventually.
16:19 <@bikcmp> yah
16:19 <@bikcmp> eh
16:19 <@bikcmp> `: i could do a url shortner
16:19 <@`> something like phpFileLocker
16:19 <@bikcmp> but a cyberlocker i don't know what it is
16:19 <@bikcmp> lol
16:19 <@`> http://code.google.com/p/phpfilelocker/
16:19 <@bikcmp> `: i hate php
16:20 <@bikcmp> python/java <3
16:20 <@`> "like"
16:20 <@bikcmp> yes, i hate java for most things
16:20 <@`> keyword thar.
16:20 <@`> im showing examples.
16:20 <@bikcmp> `: yah
16:20 <@bikcmp> just saying
16:20 <@`> a cyberlocker is basically where you can VERY QUICKLY upload incidental stuff
16:20 <@bikcmp> incidental?
16:20 <@`> like i just did with my screenshot.
16:20 <@bikcmp> `: well
16:20 <@bikcmp> ahh
16:20 <@bikcmp> i know what you want.
16:20 <@`> like, scrot, upload, link
16:20 <@`> done.
16:21 <@`> but this has to be able to accept any file
16:21 <@`> and then link them
16:21 <@`> i.e. i want to give someone a zip file
16:21 <@`> it has to accept that zip file and then urlshorten, and then spit out a url
16:21 <@bikcmp> `: well
16:21 <@bikcmp> `: i couldn't do it with self hosted
16:21 <@bikcmp> but i'd be able to make it an id service once i get authentation sorted...
16:24 <@`> nopah
16:24 <@`> *ah
16:24 <@bikcmp> `: should i make a hosted id service?
16:24 <@bikcmp> might be fun to code.
16:24 <@`> akin to openid?
16:24 <@bikcmp> `: well
16:24 <@bikcmp> `: i'm redesigning irondust's authentation.
16:24 <@bikcmp> i actually could use an unbiased opinion on it, if you feel like reading it
16:25 <@bikcmp> `: got time?
16:26 <@`> i'll see what i can do
16:27 <@bikcmp> `: basically
16:27 <@bikcmp> `: i want to change how irondust does accounts.  a lot.
16:27 <@bikcmp> i was designing a new auth gateway for websites and irondust's services (http://www.irondust.net/Login if you want)
16:27 <@bikcmp> `: anyway.  yeah
16:28 <@bikcmp> `: at the moment, irondust has one single point of failure: services.
16:28 <@bikcmp> it runs on one server.
16:28 <@`> ah yeah.
16:28 <@bikcmp> everything else irondust does is distributed and has failover plans.
16:28 <@bikcmp> completely automated failovers.
16:28 <@bikcmp> (that's why we have crazy dns)
16:28 <@`> why not have the major-trafficked ircds serve services?
16:28 <@bikcmp> `: we can't
16:28 <@`> lolcharybdis
16:28 <@bikcmp> `: we like atheme, and the ircds that have them are insane
16:28 <@bikcmp> in our eyes anyway
16:28 <@bikcmp> :P
16:29 <@bikcmp> `: so there isn't much i can do about 'services' being down on irc
16:29 <@bikcmp> since irc is a tree-shaped infra
16:29 <@`> i'd rather do anope/unreal
16:29 <@`> has been ROCK solid for me.
16:29 <@bikcmp> well
16:29 <@bikcmp> `: /me shrug
16:29 <@bikcmp> atheme is our cup of tea
16:29 <@bikcmp> hehe
16:29 <@`> not only that
16:30 <@bikcmp> `: but.  getting back to the point
16:30 <@`> anope has provisions built right in for services balancing
16:30 <@`> no fucking around. it's right there.
16:30 <@bikcmp> `: i need to make sure that web auth isn't fucked up when atheme dies.
16:30 <@bikcmp> `: anyway.  yeah.
16:30 <@bikcmp> `: i want to keep user info on the web.
16:30 <@bikcmp> on our redundant db's.
16:30 <@bikcmp> no spof.
16:31 <@bikcmp> anyway.  this means i need to do all acc operations on the web
16:31 <@bikcmp> and disable /nickserv drop, /ns register, /ns set email
16:31 <@bikcmp> etc
16:31 <@bikcmp> thoughts?
16:31 <@bikcmp> make it need to be done on the site.
16:32 <@bikcmp> be back later.
17:04 <@`> i fucking hate the guilt-trip commercials done by the ASPCA
17:04 <@`> they just MURDERED any chance of me giving any money to them
17:04 <@`> fucking assholes.
17:11 < interwarbls> lol
17:29 <@`> i would prefer to see the END RESULT
17:29 <@`> success stories.
17:29 <@`> than the BAWWWW I NEDZ HALP bullshit
19:20 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
19:21 < interwarbls> mmm, time to go ride over and see about getting some heavy whipping cream
19:21 < interwarbls> needs it for coffees :>
21:53 < interwarbls> lol
21:54 < interwarbls> dunno why, but it seems like a great time to properly clean my room
22:30 < interwarbls> the room: It loses SHIT
22:44 <@`> lolol
22:44 <@`> same thing with my phone
22:44 <@`> i just found it after losing it for a few days
22:44 <@bikcmp> `: where was it
22:44 <@`> bathroom floor inside the pocket of my dirty shorts.
22:44 <@bikcmp> ... what

22:44 <@`> i'm slightly lazy

21:25 <@bikcmp> Aranje: no idea.
21:25 <@bikcmp> :(
21:25 <@bikcmp> i don't read 10 page articles. lol
21:31 <@Aranje> I do.
21:32 <@Aranje> Then, for shorter articles, are there any news sites you particularly love? (fuck content, I'm talking nice layout etc)

18:43 <@dissimulo> i still sorta wish you'd try unreal
18:43  * dissimulo nags/hints

18:55 <@Sue> not enough money being generated
18:56 <@Sue> all your data is safe, but i cannot continue running the vps host box
18:56 <@Sue> if you need any data from your vps, right now would be the opportune time to back it up
18:58 <@Sue> and yes, Joey, i'll refund your 10 dollars of service for the pre-paid second and third month
18:58 < Joey> gah okay
18:58 <@Sue> when i have money in that account because i literally went under because the server automatically withdrew and put me in the negative
18:58 < Joey> keep the 10 for yourself
18:58 <@Sue> no, i'll refund it
18:59 < Joey> no seriously keep it i really don't want it
18:59 <@Sue> if you say so
18:59 <@Sue> i'm sorry it came to this
18:59 < Joey> you need it more than i do, most likely
19:00 <@Sue> also, if you had any personal data on your vps, you should back it up now
19:00 < Joey> yeah i'll do that
19:00 < Joey> when will it go down?
19:00 <@Sue> tomorrow afternoon
19:00 < Joey> ah okay
19:00 <@Sue> that's the final extension given to me by the DC
19:01 < Joey> alright, i'll start backing stuff up now

19:27 <@bikcmp> Joey: what is up
19:27 <@bikcmp> eh?
19:27 <@bikcmp> what.
19:37 <@bikcmp> 19:42:54  <@dissimulo> i mean, as in - try to use unreal in your implementation.
19:37 <@bikcmp> dissimulo: in regards to that
19:38 <@bikcmp> some of the bots and redundant systems we have here depend on charybdis/ircv3.1 compatable parsing
19:38 <@dissimulo> ._.
19:45 <@bikcmp> Sue: you had no idea that hh would die beforehand?
19:47 <@Sue> the funds dried up because my two large customers didn't pay
19:47 <@Sue> one actually hasn't been online in almost two months; i took over his minecraft server and have been running it myself
19:48 <@Sue> the only reason it's up is because someone donated the minimal amount of money for me to buy it a new server
19:48 <@Sue> i'm not making any money off of it though, i'm going to find a job instead because HH was never profitable
19:48 <@bikcmp> you need to do /postpaid/
19:48 <@Sue> and i need food money
19:48 <@bikcmp> come on man
19:48 <@bikcmp> POST. paid.
19:48 <@bikcmp> you pay, you get server.
19:48 <@Sue> you mean prepaid
19:48 <@bikcmp> not you get server, then after using it you pay
19:48 <@bikcmp> err
19:48 <@bikcmp> sorry
19:48 <@bikcmp> :P
19:48 <@bikcmp> you get the idea
19:49 <@Sue> i was doing that
19:49 <@bikcmp> and?
19:49 <@Sue> servers aren't cheap though
19:49 <@bikcmp> they "didn't pay"
19:49 <@bikcmp> so like
19:49 <@bikcmp> uh
19:49 <@Sue> they didn't pay the next month
19:49 <@bikcmp> yeah
19:49 <@bikcmp> ok
19:49 <@Sue> and you all had to suffer
19:49 <@Sue> because this was a terrible business plan
19:50 <@bikcmp> it was
19:53 <@bikcmp> well
19:53 <@bikcmp> Sue: i would have expected a bit more notice
22:08 <@Aranje> All of that's pretty easy to fix, though. Only do recurring payments, 3 months at a time, 5 days before your server bills. Write it in that if they're more than 3 days late, their shit gets turned off, and enforce it.
22:12 <@bikcmp> Aranje: it seems like sue's made up his mind

02:38 <@Aranje> Is that in some way confusing?
02:39 <@Aranje> cache-cleared refresh? hitting f5 twice? Or, in old days, ctrl+f5?
02:39 <@Aranje> bikcmp:) ^
02:41 <@bikcmp> o
02:44 <@Aranje> I wish programs listened to ctrl+f5, but most have lost that key combo
02:45 <@Aranje> used to be forced cache-cleared refresh every time, whereas plain f5 was a regular page reload
