00:30 <`> why'd your dad flake?
00:30 <`> this is a pretty important thing
00:31 <Sue> have you ever met someone who was so overloaded you thought they were going to explode?
00:31 <`> no.
00:31 <Sue> really.
00:31 <`> i'm so laid back to a fault.
00:31 <`> i need to stop being so laid back.
00:31 <Sue> well, he's 200% committed 200% of the time
00:32 <Sue> he simply forgot and oh well, move it to next weekend
00:32 <Sue> he's doing this for free mind you
00:32 <`> ah.
00:32 <Sue> anyway, i've got another 50$ customer coming in
00:32 <Sue> we're reaching the limit of this box
00:33 <`> good. that's good news.
00:33 <`> have we been collecting?
00:33 <Sue> collected from one
00:34 <Sue> i'm really worried (as always)
00:34 <Sue> this one is kinda dumb
00:34 <Sue> i'm worried that you're going to vlan me and none of my outbound things are gonna work
00:35 <`> sad thing is
00:35 <`> i dont know how to create a vlan
00:35 <`> i want to, but meh
00:35 <Sue> please let me teach you everything i know
00:35 <Sue> from scratch
00:35 <`> lol
00:35 <`> we'll see.
00:35 <Sue> i'm serious about the scratch bit
00:35 <Sue> we're gonna need like 3 different boxes
00:36 <`> my pfsense box
00:36 <`> is more than enough
00:36 <Sue> oh good you have pfsense
00:36 <Sue> is it 2.0 yet?
00:36 <`> 2.1-DEVELOPMENT (i386) 
00:36 <`> built on Fri May 25 06:13:59 EDT 2012 
00:36 <`> FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE-p1
00:36 <Sue> eek
00:37 <`> that has IPv6 bullshit (including DHCPv6)
00:37 <Sue> sorry, i dislike dev software on production boxes
00:37 <`> 2.0 doesn't.
00:37 <`> this particular build is good
00:37 <Sue> alright
00:37 <`> i actually updated to a newer build
00:37 <`> all ipv6 bs disappeared
00:37 <`> so i restored back.
00:38 <`> 12 Days 04 Hours 18 Minutes 58 Seconds
00:38 <`> thats its uptime (after me adding the Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel)

03:55 <Sue> hrmm
03:55 <Sue> i'm gonna need to find something with 8gb of ram
03:55 <`> i have nothing like that
03:57 <`> unless you can find something rackmountable, doable.
03:58 <`> perhaps one of those old 4U chassis?
03:58 <`> can fit almost anything in dem 4Us
04:00 <`> also, im gonna be busyasfuck tomorrow
04:01 <`> still a lot to do, and i HAVE been procrastinating a little >_>
04:01 <`> *today
04:01 <`> but yeah.
04:01 <`> i'll repeat what i said at the beginning:
04:02 <`> it's pretty fucking ghetto; and you'll be in the laundry room-turned bedroom
04:02 <`> I've made it as hospitable for you, and it's 'shared' with my room
04:03 <`> so ethernet runs are trivial, but i dont trust the long ones i have right now (record of intermittent reliability)
04:03 <`> i'll also need to flash my WRT unit with a newer version of ddwrt
04:03 <`> you'll help me with that once you get here, yes?

04:17 <Sue> dealing with people
04:19 <`> np
04:20 <`> i'll crash now so i can have more time in teh day to do shit
04:21 <Sue> fuck
04:21 <`> ?
04:21 <Sue> basically, i've got a 120 dollar customer using 8gb of ram
04:21 <Sue> and 10mbit of b/w
04:21 <`> and not paying?
04:21 <Sue> that's why i'm asking if you have a box with 8gb of ram
04:21 <Sue> no, he's paying
04:21 <Sue> but i lost the other customer
04:21 <`> what happened
04:21 <Sue> that was paying for that large box
04:21 <Sue> he doesn't have enough money
04:22 <`> ah.
04:22 <`> no, no box with remotely near 8g of ram
04:22 <Sue> we can probably fudge it or something
04:22 <Sue> or i can use my desktop
04:22 <Sue> 4gb of ram
04:22 <`> yeah, use your desktop
04:22 <Sue> won't be too horrid
04:23 <`> i have like shitloads of desktops here you can use
04:23 <Sue> oh, and i'm getting there saturday, not tomorrow
04:23 <Sue> fyi
04:23 <`> i know
04:23 <Sue> wait, saturday is tomorrow
04:23 <`> i know. :]
04:23 <Sue> lol
04:23 <Sue> and uh
04:24 <Sue> yeah we'll need to find a home for the expensive customer
04:24 <`> yeah.
04:24 <Sue> because if i can not pay 120 to another company and put that directly into "buy a nice rack server" fund
04:24 <Sue> we can fudge a mini-datacenter in your closet
04:25 <`> no closet, but cabinet
04:25 <`> but sure
04:25 <Sue> that's what i mean
04:25 <Sue> hey uh

13:59 <`> for some reason
14:00 <`> i think you should setup a totally arbitrary cron
14:00 <`> that just simply restarts the fucker every X
14:01 <`> XMLRPC?
14:01 <`> sighup?
14:02 <`> >java
14:04 <`> can i put the tuner into the i7?
14:04 <`> thanks
14:04 <Sue> there's one thing i've never done though, it's use that tuner in linux
14:04 <`> only one way to find out }:A
14:05 <Sue> so i have the weirdest dreams
14:05 <`> wanna me shut down the machine and let you check it out?
14:05 <Sue> i built a server
14:05 <Sue> then i installed debian on it
14:05 <Sue> the whole setup process
14:05 <Sue> vividly
14:05 <`> i have those too
14:06 <`> except the nightmare version would be fighting with windows install
14:06 <Sue> >implying that's a hard thing to do
14:06 <Sue> >next
14:06 <Sue> >next
14:06 <Sue> >next
14:06 <`> lol, no
14:06 <Sue> >next
14:06 <Sue> >next
14:06 <`> on a broken system
14:06 <`> etc etc
14:06 <Sue> done
14:06 <`> just
14:06 <Sue> lol
14:06 <`> nightmare version
14:06 <`> think about it
14:06 <`> when you're literally pulling your hair out etc
14:06 <`> anyway
14:06 <`> wanna pull out the i7?
14:07 <Sue> it's not running any public services, is it?
14:07 <`> only httpd
14:07 <Sue> >uptime
14:07 <Sue> not that kind of uptime
14:07 <Sue> website uptime
14:07 <`> nothing major is being hosted
14:07 <`> it's just supplemental shit
14:07 <Sue> alright...
14:08 <Sue> if there's one thing you'll learn very fast about me, i cannot have public shit go offline
14:08 <`> i mostly use this httpd to move pirated stuff
14:08 <`> or personal shit
14:08 <`> so nothing critical at all
14:08 <`> i fucking need to update my pingdom
14:09 <`> i havent used that in almost a year
14:11 <`> heavy motherfucker
14:12 <Sue> can you tell where i was like ok uptime is important
14:14 <Sue> already have a eth for you ready to be routed out here... its the yellow cable
14:14 <Sue> i was saying use that as a switch
14:15 <Sue> as we go along i'll figure this shit
14:15 <Sue> also need i remind you of bookshelf
14:16 <Sue> he's getting mad
14:19 <Sue> we'll figure it out, lets get the heavy stuff placed down first
14:22 <Sue> just put the tv card at the bottom, it'll fit just fine
