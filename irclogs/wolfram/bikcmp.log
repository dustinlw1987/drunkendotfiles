17:01 <bikcmp> blargh
17:01 <bikcmp> joey is pissing me off
17:01 <bikcmp> joey = shadow
17:01 <bikcmp> 14:51:17  <@Shadow> bikcmp, but how would i implement that into the ircd
17:01 <bikcmp> 14:57:57  < bikcmp> Shadow: uh
17:01 <bikcmp> 14:57:59  < bikcmp> Shadow: dude
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:01  < bikcmp> it's already in there
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:14  <@Shadow> okay so like
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:18  <@Shadow> what do i do to use it
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:24  < bikcmp> ... you uncomment the line
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:26  < bikcmp> that's it
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:28  < bikcmp> lol
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:34  <@Shadow> which line
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:39  < bikcmp> i don't know?
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:45  < bikcmp> learn to do it yourself?
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:58:58   * Shadow mentions something about a managed vps :\
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:59:16  < bikcmp> Shadow: in which case you should have no access to the vps at all
17:02 <bikcmp> 14:59:19  < bikcmp> :p
17:03 <bikcmp> 14:59:33  < bikcmp> Shadow: i told you from the start that i would help with an occasional thing, but not do everything for
17:03 <bikcmp>                     you
17:03 <bikcmp> i told him before he did /anything/ that i wouldn't do everything for him

18:42 <bikcmp> 15:00:10  <bikcmp> 14:59:16  < bikcmp> Shadow: in which case you should have no access to the vps at all
18:42 <bikcmp> entirely true
18:42 <bikcmp> but i told him before he bought the vps that i'd help him on occasion
18:42 <bikcmp> and understandably not hold his hand or give him any code/tips from irondust, since we'd be a competing network
18:42 <bikcmp> well
18:43 <bikcmp> you know, not competing like that

23:07 <bikcmp> i have these, like, moods.
23:07 <bikcmp> i think i have a degree of bipolar.
23:07 <bikcmp> (i stay off irc when i don't feel ok)
23:08 <bikcmp> so you don't see it
23:08 <bikcmp> but anyway
23:08 <bikcmp> this dude in #social on this network was like
23:08 <bikcmp> going on about how he has a 5 gig text file
23:08 <bikcmp> and can't open it.
23:08 <bikcmp> so, i asked him to pastebin the first 100 lines.
23:08 <bikcmp> i coded something for him to use in python.
23:08 <bikcmp> and, it wouldn't hog his memory.
23:09 <bikcmp> then he's like, "I WANT TO DO IT IN PHP AND I KNOW PHP CAN DO IT"
23:09 <bikcmp> so i'm like
23:09 <bikcmp> WHY DID YOU ASK ME THEN?
23:09 <bikcmp> he's like, "i thought you'd have shut up by now"
23:09 <`> lol
23:09 <`> that's an asshole, if i heard anything
23:10 <bikcmp> 21:04:49  < langkid1> I used PHP
23:10 <bikcmp> 21:04:58  < langkid1> it can read it in a way that doesn't hog memory
23:10 <bikcmp> 21:05:07  < bikcmp> langkid1: then why are you asking us for help?
23:10 <bikcmp> 21:05:10  < langkid1> that paste was just the first 1000 lines

00:39 <bikcmp> sorry
00:39 <bikcmp> didn't see your pm
00:39 <bikcmp> i'm 16
00:40 <bikcmp> why
00:42 <`> just wondering.
00:42 <bikcmp> fwiw, sue is aware
00:45 <bikcmp> the reason i'm doing some stuff that you wouldn't imagine a kid doing is because i'm growing up in an extremely extremely dysfunctional family.
00:45 <bikcmp> dad is pretty much paralized and extremely lazy: the only reason he gets up out of this chair is to go to the bathroom. 
00:46 <bikcmp> mom is getting the backlash from her smoking habbits, and it's too late to stop it.
00:46 <bikcmp> brother has some sort of mental disability. 
00:46 <bikcmp> so there I am.  :(
00:47 <`> i'm deaf, my family has shunned me, and i had to drop out of school because admins were fucking me over.
00:47 <`> etc.
00:48 <`> nobodys perfect.
00:48 <bikcmp> it seems as if everyone on irc has problems
00:48 <bikcmp> s/on irc//
00:48 <bikcmp> oh. and family won't bother taking me to any asl classes
00:49 <bikcmp> since my hearing is definitely going to be completely gone within the next 5 years
00:49 <bikcmp> so it's pretty much up to the internet.
00:49 <bikcmp> that, or I learn to bike 30 miles a day. 
00:50 <`> no public transportation?
00:50 <bikcmp> hell
00:50 <bikcmp> it'd be like
00:50 <bikcmp> a hell of a hard time trying to get there
00:50 <bikcmp> a train would take me /very/ far away from where i want
00:50 <bikcmp> and like, an hour before it starts
00:51 <bikcmp> and it'd be pitch black out 
00:51 <bikcmp> so yeah
00:51 <bikcmp> it isn't an option
00:51 <bikcmp> it's online or nothing
00:53 <`> where the hell are you? you sound as if you're from bumsville, idaho
00:55 <bikcmp> haha
00:55 <bikcmp> i'm from like
00:55 <bikcmp> cherry hill nj
00:55 <bikcmp> a small town around it
00:55 <bikcmp> the ironic part is that it's a really expensive place to live
00:55 <bikcmp> but like
00:55 <bikcmp> all the money is going towards dad's healthcare
00:55 <bikcmp> when he doesn't even care if he gets better
00:56 <`> jersey?
00:56 <`> you actually live in jersey?
00:56 <bikcmp> yes
00:56 <bikcmp> i do
00:56 <bikcmp> it sucks fucking ass
00:57 <`> so i've heard.
00:57 <bikcmp> i'm so moving the day I turn 18
00:57 <bikcmp> that, or go and stay at a college.
00:58 <bikcmp> i got tired of living at home when I was ten.
00:58 <bikcmp> so yeah.
00:59 <`> i actually moved out when i was 16
00:59 <`> but i digress.
00:59 <bikcmp> eh?
00:59 <bikcmp> did you get a court order?
01:00 <bikcmp> i do forget what it's called.
01:00 <bikcmp> it's when they deem you not a minor.
01:00 <`> no, got my mom to sign away her rights to me
01:00 <bikcmp> eh?
01:00 <bikcmp> that's legal?
01:00 <`> then i moved out of state
01:00 <bikcmp> plus, who paid for your housing?
01:00 <`> here's the thing
01:00 <`> Social Security Disability
01:01 <`> also happens to 'cover' deafness.
01:01 <`> so i draw a check from uncle sam every month
01:01 <bikcmp> so you used funds from that, and lived frugally?
01:01 <`> yep.
01:01 <bikcmp> ah
01:01 <`> ended up in South Carolina
01:01 <bikcmp> you sound like my uncle.  
01:02 <bikcmp> he's, like, the most cheap person you could imagine.
01:02 <`> got a rentfree house all to myself
01:02 <bikcmp> eh? rentfree? how did you manage that
01:02 <bikcmp> loan?
01:02 <bikcmp> no, wait
01:02 <bikcmp> you can't take a loan out at 16
01:02 <bikcmp> that's the thing
01:02 <bikcmp> contracts at 16 are not legally binding
01:02 <bikcmp> ie, who would sell you a house
01:02 <bikcmp> who would rent you an apt?
01:02 <`> went to school there - they gave me a hell of a time since i was a minor
01:03 <`> and i had a online friend
01:03 <`> who happened to inherit his mom's property
01:03 <`> it was dirty as fuck when i moved in, but i made it livable
01:03 <bikcmp> ahh
01:04 <bikcmp> and taxes
01:04 <bikcmp> ?
01:04 <`> the house doesn't exist anymorefucking screen.
01:04 <`> fixed.
01:04 <`> anyway, he paid the taxes (which amounted to something like 50 a year or something
01:05 <`> so all i paid was my living expenses (utilites and bs)
01:05 <bikcmp> $50?
01:05 <bikcmp> the taxes were $50 a year?
01:05 <`> something like that
01:05 <bikcmp> ... what
01:05 <`> i could be wrong
01:05 <bikcmp> the taxes in new jersey are about $20,000
01:05 <`> it was out in the in the country
01:05 <bikcmp> (fuck nj)
01:05 <bikcmp> yeah
01:05 <bikcmp> i know
01:05 <bikcmp> i'm either going to canada or CA
01:05 <bikcmp> i fucking hate nj
01:05 <`> 110 N. Perkins Creek Rd. Seneca, SC 29678
01:06 <`> crazy that i still remember the address
01:06 <bikcmp> you live at 130 something now
01:06 <bikcmp> 1606 something
01:06 <`> 13063
01:06 <bikcmp> that's it
01:06 <bikcmp> i've never heard of Yucaipa before in my life
01:06 <bikcmp> small town?
01:07 <`> ish
01:07 <bikcmp> 20k?
01:07 <`> http://dgd.io/dtCm
01:07 <bikcmp> ah
01:07 <bikcmp> that isn't too bad
01:07 <bikcmp> 60k is a nice size
01:07 <bikcmp> what's the avg temp?
01:08 <bikcmp> nj has these crazy hot summers and these FUCKING COLD winters
01:08 <bikcmp> like, tomorrow it'll be 100f
01:08 <bikcmp> 6 months ago it was like, 15f
01:09 <bikcmp> how far away is SF, too
01:10 <bikcmp> oh 
01:10 <bikcmp> lol
01:10 <bikcmp> 7 hours, uh
01:10 <`> yeah
01:10 <`> not that far with public transportation
01:10 <bikcmp> uh
01:10 <bikcmp> 7 hours is a bit far
01:10 <bikcmp> lol
01:11 <`> you can get all the way up to Northridge using bus, train, subway, train in that order
01:11 <bikcmp> ooh
01:11 <bikcmp> so wait
01:11 <`> and i can get up there in about 4-5 hours.
01:11 <bikcmp> you could take a train from yukohaijsdj to san fran?
01:11 <`> no
01:11 <bikcmp> aww
01:11 <bikcmp> sounded too good to be true
01:11 <`> nearest train station is San Bernardino
01:11 <`> which is... 35ish miles away
01:11 <bikcmp> and how far away is that?
01:11 <bikcmp> ah
01:11 <`> so bus direct to san berdo
01:11 <bikcmp> 35 miles is a bit of a drive, still
01:12 <`> (theres even a bus that takes me directly there, even)
01:12 <bikcmp> hah
01:12 <bikcmp> nj's public transport sucks ass
01:12 <`> then train directly into Downtown Los Angeles
01:12 <`> for $5
01:12 <bikcmp> yeah
01:12 <bikcmp> then in la?
01:12 <`> then it's about $2 for the subway directly into West Hollywood / Universal City
01:13 <bikcmp> how far away is that?
01:13 <`> then one more bus directly into Northridge
01:13 <`> here, lemme get you the route
01:13 <bikcmp> i'm not actually going to do it... but it's kinda involved!
01:14 <`> not for me
01:14 <`> it's actually fun.
01:14 <bikcmp> eh
01:14 <bikcmp> maybe
01:14 <`> http://goo.gl/maps/TaLZ
01:14 <bikcmp> <# google
01:15 <`> heh yeah.
01:15 <`> but yeah
01:15 <`> using my iphone with google maps
01:15 <`> it's fucking impossible to get lost
01:15 <`> coupled with public transportation
01:15 <`> equals epic win
01:16 <`> southern Cali is real nice,
01:16 <`> talk in #hh
01:16 <bikcmp> ick, iphone is bleh

17:29 <`> yeah.
17:29 <bikcmp> your nick is so small i don't see when you highlight me
17:29 <bikcmp> so
17:29 <bikcmp> basically
17:29 <`> lol
17:29 <`> < minimalist asshole
17:29 <bikcmp> you know what happened with the whole spitfire/nightmare flooding shit
17:29 <bikcmp> right
17:30 <`> yeah. go on.
17:30 <bikcmp> so
17:30 <bikcmp> a friend of mine (who isn't affiliated with this and has no idea what's going on, i haven't talked to him since may)
17:30 <bikcmp> owns the biggest chan on id.
17:30 <bikcmp> #terraria
17:30 <bikcmp> spitfire and i had equal power, including founder.
17:31 <bikcmp> spitfire removed that and banned me from it.
17:31 <`> not cool.
17:31 <bikcmp> he's also doing the floods.
17:31 <bikcmp> there have been a lot of floods on id, in chans he's all in.
17:31 <`> if he's still continuing doing that
17:31 <`> give me netadmin, damn it
17:31 <bikcmp> i've also seen logs of him talk to his 'friend'
17:31 <bikcmp> asking for floods.
17:31 <`> gline the hell out of him
17:31 <`> you know what
17:31 <bikcmp> what should i do re: #terraria
17:31 <bikcmp> and, yes
17:32 <bikcmp> if you are interested and can be on irondust more
17:32 <`> your ircds do not allow you to have finer-grain control over stuff
17:32 <bikcmp> i'd be more than happy to give you oper.
17:32 <`> which sorta bugs me :P
17:32 <bikcmp> well
17:32 <bikcmp> we removed a lot of that stuff.
17:32 <bikcmp> if i wanted to do it, i can do it.
17:32 <`> yes, well
17:32 <bikcmp> just, only i and one other person who i entirely trust can do it
17:32 <bikcmp> others can't touch it.
17:32 <`> right.
17:32 <bikcmp> so
17:32 <`> with me, i do NOT tolerate abuse of my networks
17:32 <bikcmp> what are your thoughts?
17:32 <`> so i typically remove all 'powers'
17:33 <bikcmp> ban him, restore normal flags in #terraria before him
17:33 <bikcmp> yeah?
17:33 <bikcmp> i have a backup of services from a while ago, i could look up exactly what flags i had.
17:33 <`> and then use my operoverride to get back in to a channel
17:33 <bikcmp> we don't have operoverride
17:33 <`> that's another problem.
17:33 <bikcmp> we /do/ have a services mode that can let us do some stuff.
17:33 <bikcmp> but, it's basically "Only bikcmp can do that."
17:33 <`> operoverride is TOO useful in situations like this
17:33 <`> and
17:34 <`> i require the use of SVSJOIN and SVSPART
17:34 <bikcmp> we don't have /any/ way to do svsjoin/part
17:34 <bikcmp> i couldn't do it even if i wanted to
17:34 <bikcmp> well
17:34 <bikcmp> svspart a bit
17:34 <`> there you go.
17:34 <`> too limited.
17:34 <bikcmp> i can make a channel die.
17:34 <`> on the admin side
17:34 <bikcmp> /clearchan kick #xyz.
17:34 <`> yeah, well
17:34 <bikcmp> let's not get into that now
17:34 <bikcmp> should i do it, yes/no
17:34 <bikcmp> i emailed the owner of the channel a while ago
17:34 <`> yes.
17:34 <bikcmp> i say restore it to where it was pending resolution
17:35 <`> he's abusing.
17:35 <bikcmp> if the owner of the chan wants it the way it is right now, fair enough
17:35 <`> plain and simple.
17:35 <bikcmp> ok
17:35 <`> violating the TOS
17:35 <`> by flooding.
17:35 <bikcmp> he could come back and say "it wasn't me"
17:35 <`> fuck him.
17:35 <bikcmp> ikr
17:35 <bikcmp> lol
17:35 <`> im sorry to be an hardass
17:35 <bikcmp> no, i like that.
17:35 <`> but seriously, you have logs
17:35 <bikcmp> yeah
17:35 <bikcmp> well
17:35 <`> he can't go "it wasnt me"
17:35 <`> it was his system
17:36 <bikcmp> let me restore the channel as to where it was 3 weeks ago.
17:36 <`> he's responsible for it.
17:36 <`> even if it was hacked or bullshit, he's still responsible
17:36 <bikcmp> hacked, eh
17:36 <bikcmp> if it was a one time 'i'm hacked' thing
17:36 <bikcmp> i'd be more leanient
17:36 <bikcmp> but if it's repetive, yeah
17:36 <bikcmp> and it was
17:36 <`> i.e. he says "oh dude, it wasnt me, i was hacked"
17:36 <`> to cover up, i'll call bullshit
17:36 <`> yeah.
17:36 <bikcmp> ok, i'm going back to the way #terraria was july 6
17:36 <`> okies.
17:37 <`> let me know once its restored
17:37 <bikcmp> i'm then going to freeze his account, so he can no longer make any changes.
17:37 <bikcmp> well
17:37 <bikcmp> right now i'm loading up the archive
17:37 <`> so i can get into #terraria or whatever it was.
17:37 <bikcmp> i make backups every 2 days or so on my local computer.
17:37 <bikcmp> and backups every minute to other remote machines
17:37 <`> nice.
17:38 <bikcmp> man
17:38 <bikcmp> that's sick
17:38 <bikcmp> MDA #terraria:*!ddoscomin@ebbnjey.irondust.net reason you're a very bad girl ;
17:38 <bikcmp> that's a memo to his girlfriend
17:38 <bikcmp> i need to go deep into the database to find the flags
17:38 <bikcmp> hm
17:39 <bikcmp> it actually looks like he planned for this to happen.
17:39 <bikcmp> there are no flags whatsoever in #terraria.
17:39 <bikcmp> as far back as my backups go.
17:39 <bikcmp> so as of july 6, i was not banned
17:39 <bikcmp> but i was not an op.
17:39 <`> then kill him off entirely. he's being unsafe to the security of the network.
17:39 <bikcmp> i plan to
17:39 <bikcmp> but i mean
17:39 <bikcmp> what should i do in regards to flags
17:39 <bikcmp> if my oldest backup says i have no flags...
17:40 <bikcmp> and i'm killing off the most active op off of #terraria...
17:40 <bikcmp> you know?
17:41 <`> most active or not, he's being active in bascially destroying the network
17:41 <`> (sorry, laptop died)
17:42 <`> should i go into there?
17:44 <bikcmp> if you want
17:44 <bikcmp> well
17:44 <bikcmp> ok
17:44 <bikcmp> so
17:44 <bikcmp> i'm going to restore the channel exactly how it was july 6
17:44 <bikcmp> before this bullcrap mostly happened
17:44 <bikcmp> i know i had flags in there before july 6
17:44 <bikcmp> but hey
17:44 <bikcmp> whatever
17:45 <`> yeah.
17:45 <bikcmp> i have proof i wasn't banned on the 6
17:45 <`> let me know once it's restored
17:45 <bikcmp> well
17:45 <bikcmp> here's the thing
17:45 <bikcmp> i think it's going to say "bikcmp forced flags -b" as a notice.
17:45 <bikcmp> lol
17:45 <bikcmp> which understandably would make me look really bad.
17:46 <bikcmp> i'm thinking modify the database while services are dead, but like
17:46  * bikcmp shrug.
17:48 <`> yeah.
17:48 <`> or let me do it.
17:48 <bikcmp> if you want
17:48 <bikcmp> i'd like it if you picked a name that isn't one character though
17:48 <bikcmp> lol
17:48 <`> and i'll just come in and be all "now what, bitches" (not literally, but yeah)
17:48 <bikcmp> i can't even see it
17:48 <bikcmp> it looks like < > is pm'ing me
17:48 <bikcmp> lol
17:48 <`> haha
17:49 <`> epic.
17:49 <bikcmp> yeah thoug
17:49 <bikcmp> i'm afraid that people are not going to be able to see your name ;p
17:49 <`> :P

18:25 <bikcmp> he paid you for the month how long ago
18:25 <dissimulo> first of the month.
18:27 <bikcmp> so
18:27 <bikcmp> it's the 23rd

18:28 <bikcmp> er
18:28 <bikcmp> well
18:28 <bikcmp> last day paid
18:28 <bikcmp> so i'd say kick him out today

18:29 <bikcmp> hmm
18:30 <bikcmp> i hope that the cat is ok

20:04 <bikcmp> 21:03:21  <Spitfire> I thought that was a pretty obvious joke. =p
20:04 <bikcmp> 21:03:32  <bikcmp> ... yeah.
20:04 <bikcmp> 21:03:36  <Spitfire> Was a reference to the guy you just added as a staffer who no one has heard of. ^_^

19:31 <dissimulo> as in, 30d notice if server goes down, etc
19:31 <dissimulo> not a last min 24h notice :|

16:14 <bikcmp> ok
16:14 <bikcmp> give me a hash of your password
16:14 <dissimulo> what type of hash
16:14 <bikcmp> and what ips will you be connecting from
16:14 <bikcmp> any
16:14 <dissimulo> i kinda use ripemd
16:14 <bikcmp> md5, sha1
16:15 <bikcmp> what
16:15 <bikcmp> mkpasswd
16:15 <bikcmp> use mkpasswd
16:15 <bikcmp> lol
16:15 <dissimulo> i use mkpasswd with ripemd
16:15 <dissimulo> :P
16:15 <bikcmp> then it'll probably work.
16:15  * bikcmp :X
16:15 <bikcmp> lol
16:15 <bikcmp> also, get off of wolfram.
16:15 <dissimulo> why
16:15 <bikcmp> wolfram isn't an active server, so oper blocks won't propgate to it
16:16 <bikcmp> wolfram is going down, well
16:16 <bikcmp> two days ago
16:16 <bikcmp> lol
16:16 <dissimulo> lol
16:16 <dissimulo> well
16:16 <dissimulo> since i can't /map
16:16 <dissimulo> give me the /map
16:16 <bikcmp> use irc.irondust.net
16:16 <bikcmp> it's automatic
16:16 <dissimulo> i know
16:16 <bikcmp> never connect to a single server
16:16 <dissimulo> i'm weird enough to not like roundrobin'd
16:17 <bikcmp> it isn't round robin
16:17 <bikcmp> lol
16:17 <dissimulo> whatever
16:17 <dissimulo> every time i irc.
16:17 <dissimulo> it goes to wolfram
16:17 <dissimulo> all the time
16:17 <dissimulo> for me
16:17 <bikcmp> it will not this time
16:17 <bikcmp> i assure you
16:17 <bikcmp> irc.g.irondust.net descriptive text "client is 76.96.13.151 / client's region is unknown / server is fra07s07-in-f57.rev.irondust.net / server version is r9"
16:17 <dissimulo> also
16:18 <dissimulo> which ripemd
16:18 <bikcmp> i have no idea 
16:18 <bikcmp> lol
16:18 <dissimulo> ._.
16:18 <dissimulo> fine, i'll use ripemd128
16:18 <bikcmp> i don't use ripemd
16:18 <bikcmp> seriously
16:18 <bikcmp> lol
16:18 <dissimulo> ripemd is secure than md5/sha1
16:18 <dissimulo> just saiyan
16:18 <bikcmp> i use sha512
16:19 <bikcmp> the way i hash user passwords would be rather hard to crack
16:19 <dissimulo> :P
16:20 <dissimulo> fuck it
16:20 <dissimulo> i'll just save you time
16:20 <bikcmp> just give me a fucking hash
16:20 <bikcmp> lol
16:20 <bikcmp> i don't care if it's md1
16:21 <bikcmp> (exists?)
16:21 <dissimulo> use
16:21 <dissimulo> md1 is not even secure
16:21 <dissimulo> it's considered unencrypted
16:22 <bikcmp> i know :p
16:22 <dissimulo> >mfw mkpasswd isnt found
16:22 <dissimulo> time to get in as root
16:24 <dissimulo> ircd@cookiemonster:~/Unreal3.2$ ./unreal mkpasswd sha1 xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
16:24 <dissimulo> Encrypted password is: $yYpUZ9l1$HnVW9oO98xSkAchpFhN9vMW42Eg=
16:24 <bikcmp> ok
16:25 <bikcmp> reconnect to irc.irondust.net
16:25 <bikcmp> wolfram's files are wiped
