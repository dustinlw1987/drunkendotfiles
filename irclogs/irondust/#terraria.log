11:13 < Da_Wrecka> You know, I was almost tempted to get Iron Brigade on Steam. But then I noticed the "Games for Windows Live account required" and I thought "Pfft, fuck that."
11:14 < Nyx> According to my friend, Iron Brigade is like Orcs Must Die! in a different setting
11:14 < Nyx> So grab OMD2 instead.
11:14 < Da_Wrecka> the setting is what makes it for me
11:15 < Da_Wrecka> Turrets and artillery are fun for me. Swords and sorcery, generally not.
11:15 < Nyx> Ah, oh well then

11:26 < Da_Wrecka> ...huh. I thought using the Wikipedia "List of Games For Windows Live titles" would simplify my future buying practices, but apparently it's not quite that simple... I'd forgotten that Fallout 3 is technically a GfWL game. The difference? It's possible to play Fallout 3 without GfWL and see no appreciable difference
11:27 < Da_Wrecka> (it won't track your achievements, but honestly, who gives the first shit about achievements?)

11:30 < Nyx> Why're achievement hunters automatically imbeciles?
11:31 < Da_Wrecka> Because achievements are completely valueless. They're an online dick-waving contest and nothing more. If you're doing something retarded not because it's entertaining but purely to get an achievement out of it, guess what? You're a retard.

11:32 < plaYer2k> that might be your opinion, just dont do the achvievements then
11:32 -!- megaman [~webchat@u535-044-90-13.bchsia.telus.net] has joined #terraria
11:33 < Da_Wrecka> TF2 SORT OF does achievements right, in that some of them give you rewards beyond making your e-penis bigger.
11:33 < plaYer2k> for me some achievements are a nice challenge within the game you sometimes have to know alot about the game and its mechanic before you can gain it
11:33 < Nyx> Not everyone goes after achievements purely for the achievement. There are plenty of games where achievements are awarded for something slightly/quite challenging
11:33 < Da_Wrecka> But there's an awful lot that are just that, e-penis and nothing more
11:33 < megaman> my teraria wont work
11:34 -!- megaman [~webchat@u535-044-90-13.bchsia.telus.net] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
11:35 < Nyx> Building off of what plaYer said, going after an achievement can also help you learn more mechanics of a game, which can change how you play in the future.
11:35 -!- Yatagarasu [~webchat@83-94-663-70.adsl.highway.telekom.at] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
11:36 < Nyx> Achievement hunting just for the sake of having the achievement itself is silly, yes. Achievement hunting to get achievements that are actually challenging, not so much.
11:37 < plaYer2k> well sure, there are some achievements like "kill 100000000 enemies" or "do 10000 headshots" but there are also some achievements like in AlienSwarm were you had speedrun achievements that require good teamplay, knowledge about game and map and sometimes luck
11:38 < Da_Wrecka> If the challenge is entertaining to you, then okay, I concede the point. But how many "achievement hunters" are doing it not for challenge but the "ding!" itself? Because frankly, I'm willing to bet that there's a LOT more who go for the e-penis more than the challenge.
11:39 < Nyx> Not gonna argue with you about a lot of them doing it for the e-peen, but not all of them do.
11:39 < plaYer2k> well then iam a e-peen guy for you
11:39 -!- JStoker [~jstoker@staff/JStoker] has quit [Quit: JStoker is gone :(]
11:39 < plaYer2k> when i like a game i try to make the achievements to
11:39 < plaYer2k> too*
11:39 < Da_Wrecka> I guess we've found middle ground then. I can understand people looking at the list of achievements and thinking "Hey, that sounds like it might be fun." And I have no problem with those people.
11:40 -!- Agent007 [~webchat@nw-43.475.ru] has joined #terraria
11:40 < plaYer2k> and yet you think they are dumbasses and retards? ...
11:40 < Da_Wrecka> It's the people who look at the list of achievements and go "ACHIEVEMENT! MUST GET!" that I have absolute contempt for.
11:40 < Agent007> люди
11:40 < Agent007> кто русс
11:40 < Nyx> Eh, if all that's left of a games achievements are the easy ones that take some time and not much effort, as long as there aren't too many I'll try to finish up the achievements for the game.
11:40 < Agent007> че
11:41 < Da_Wrecka> I can relate to that.

11:41 < Da_Wrecka> By the time I'd finished Deathspank, I had one achievement un-unlocked. So I thought "Ahh, fuck it. Not gonna take too long to hit level 20."
11:43 < Da_Wrecka> Likewise, Bayonetta. I'd unlocked every achievement but the one for beating Infinite Climax, so I thought "Fuck it."
11:44 < Da_Wrecka> But when I look at the Borderlands list and see I haven't got the achievement for... umm... huh. I seem to have all of those achievements. Huh.
11:44 < Da_Wrecka> oh no, wait, I don't, misreading the list
11:44 < Da_Wrecka> Yeah, Borderlands just stopped unlocking achievements for me for some reason. Do I care? No, not really.
11:45 < Da_Wrecka> most of them are needless busywork anyway.
11:47 < Nyx> Only achievements I really don't have are the arena ones for the Underdome and a couple from the Robolution.
11:47 < Nyx> For Borderlands^^
11:47 < Da_Wrecka> I SHOULD have all of the arena ones and Robolution ones, but Borderlands just decided "Fuck this achievements bullshit" at some point and I never really noticed.
11:47 < Nyx> xD
11:48 < Nyx> Crawmerax is annoying, btw.
11:48 < Nyx> >_>
11:49 < Da_Wrecka> I concur
11:49 < Nyx> Pity there wasn't a Crawmer-Trap in Robolution. Ultimate boss fight.
11:49 < Da_Wrecka> I think I can live without that.
11:49 < Nyx> xD
11:49 < Da_Wrecka> Besides, there'd be no real point to it anyway, Pearlescents don't drop outside DLC3 areas.
11:50 < Nyx> Do it for the challenge.
11:50 < Nyx> Do it for all the money you can get! Which apparently caps out at...*checks*
11:50 < Da_Wrecka> That sounds less like "challenge" and more like "masochism".
11:50 < Da_Wrecka> It caps out at (whatever the maximum value for a signed 32-bit integer is)
11:51 < Da_Wrecka> but the display caps out at 10m, so you'll never no until all of a sudden your money flips back to zero
11:51 < Da_Wrecka> *never know
11:52 < Nyx> Or until you die and see how much money you lose.
11:52 < Da_Wrecka> even then, you'd only find out if you whip out a calculator
11:52 < Nyx> Apparently someone hit the actual cap and kept getting 0 whenever he picked up money.
11:53 < Nyx> 2,147,482,740 moneys
11:54 < Nyx> Up in that area, at least.
11:57 < Da_Wrecka> In my experience, it'll just keep going up and up until you hit that value, then it'll wrap around to negative. Next time you pick up money, the game will go "'ang on" and reset you to zero. Or something. I forget exactly.

12:03 < Nyx> ...Still trying to figure out when I got this spare copy of Nuclear Dawn...
12:03 < Nyx> Want it, Da_Wrecka?
12:05 < Da_Wrecka> What is it?
12:05  * Da_Wrecka has never heard of it before
12:06 < Nyx> FPS/RTS mix
12:07 < Nyx> Class/team based as well. Most people are playing FPS-ish, one person on each team enters a building and is playing it like an RTS. Building stuff, directing their teammates where to go
12:07 < Nyx> Overhead view of the area
12:07 < Da_Wrecka> Hmm... Thank you, but I'll pass. Hang on to it for someone who's sure they want it.

17:10 < Zarf> Right-click on the entry in your Steam menu...
17:10 < Ray> the entry?
17:10 < Zarf> Then hit "Delete Local Content". BUT FIRST: make sure you backup your worlds!
17:11 < Ray> how do i backup my worlds?
17:11 < Zarf> Yeah, right-click on Terraria in the Steam menu.
17:11 < Zarf> Not sure - I've never done it before. If you can stand to lose your worlds and characters, delete away. Otherwise, let me check...
17:11 < Ray> i have a lot of things
17:11 < Zarf> http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/backing-up-character-worlds.15983/
17:11 < Ray> i had killed the giant worm like 10 times
17:12 < Ray> and found like 5 meteors
17:12 < Zarf> Wow! Yeah, they are worth saving.
17:12 < Zarf> That link has instructions on how to back up your stuff.
17:12 < Ray> i kinda dont care wether or not i backup my worlds
17:12 < Ray> but i guess i will
17:12 < Ray> brb
17:12 < Zarf> Ok. Good luck!

17:17 < Luna> zarf
17:17 < Luna> yes
17:18 < Ray> do you know how to delete and redownload terraria?
17:18 < Zarf> Whoops, sorry, I'm back.
17:18 < Ray> zarf
17:18 < Zarf> Ok, did you follow the instructions on that link?
17:18 < Ray> how do i redownload terraria
17:18 < Ray> yes i did
17:19 < Zarf> If you've deleted the local content, all you need to do is find it in your Steam Menu, double-click on it, and click Next a few times.
17:19 < Zarf> It needs to re-download, so it won't be instant.
17:19 < Ray> ok
17:19 < Ray> brb
17:20 < Zarf> Once that's done, run the game once.
17:20 < Zarf> Try making a new world. If that works, exit out of the game and copy your stuff back to where it was.
17:20 < Ray> k
17:20 < Ray> its downloading now
17:21 < Ray> brb im going to see if it worked

07:11 < Andrio> Hello, Amdalina.
07:11 < Amdalina> How are you?
07:11 < Andrio> I'm well.
07:12 < Andrio> I failed to defeat The Twins today, but still, I'm well.
07:12 < Amdalina> I'm well too/
07:13 < Andrio> I've found out that it's very cheap to reforge a cross necklace.
07:13 < Andrio> Something like 15 silver a pop
07:13 < Andrio> So now I have a Warding Cross Necklace and I'm only 5 gold in the hole :)
07:14 < xPi> have you tried hiding behind blocks from twins projectiles?
07:14 < Andrio> Don't they go through blocks, though?
07:15 < xPi> they stay a distance and seem to need line of sight

23:43 < Sunra> Hey.
23:43 < Hope_Estheim> Are you related to Mum-ra, the Everlasting?
23:44 < Sunra> I'm a young aspiring poet, and my friends were telling me that there were a couple caring Game Devs here?
23:44 < Sunra> No, no I'm not unfortunately.
23:44 < Hope_Estheim> There are in fact no active game devs in here right now.
23:44 < Sunra> I kinda' wrote a poem dedicated to Terraria.
23:44 < Sunra> That's too bad. D:
23:44 < Sunra> I wanted to share it with them.
23:44 < Hope_Estheim> Put it on Terraria Online's forum, where more than two people will see it.
23:44 < Sunra> Well, I have a mental condition.
23:45 < Lover> we have come with means of affectionate and inspired means of his great performance's
23:45 < Lover> also his wonderful poetry
23:45 < Sunra> It makes it really difficult for me to type in a space with more than one line.
23:45 < Lover> such a powerful individual
23:45 < Hope_Estheim> Sunra.
23:45 < Sunra> Hmm?
23:45 < Hope_Estheim> You will type your poem in one line.
23:45 < Hope_Estheim> On the forum.
23:45 < Hope_Estheim> It will word wrap.
23:45 < Hope_Estheim> And you shall claim that it is a new style of poetry that you are developing.
23:45 < Sunra> Oh.
23:45 < Sunra> Well that's a wonderful idea!
23:45 < Sunra> Will you take a quick read over my poem first?
23:46 < Hope_Estheim> Sure.
23:46 < Sunra> Like a flock of bats careening seemlessly through their cave.Like a cruise ship's effortless journey through the sea.A rush of beautiful brown liquid.Chunky, ridden with stench.It spews softly from the puckered lips of my anus.The gaping maw that is my asshole splits apart allowing the glorious diarrhea to exit its previous cavern and be born anew.My poop on Terraria's face.
23:46 < Lover> and mine as well good sir!
23:46 < Lover> please !
23:46 < Lover>  eyes like velvet mountain's, blankets of the closed mouth loud children of the cold beaded together spec by specas the fleshy oval openingof my gaping fish stenched pale ass cheeksopen like a stoic castle gatequivering with a pink envy of digested loveand fabricated fecal matterendlessly flowing into my undying lover's mouthmy lustful need, oh Terraria developer, no womans touch, as good as the howling diversity of my anal capacity.

21:58 <@Marketh> the TO forums worry me

21:58 < Hope_Estheim1> My response to your post I mean.
21:59 < Scizor300> maybe i should also post my game design doc to see how much hate i can garner
21:59 <@Marketh> Where is Nightmare's famous "whatever" shrug ascii art when I need it
21:59 < Scizor300> in fact i will
22:00 <@Marketh> That would sum up my opinion on anything relating to the TO forums
22:00 < Scizor300> the TO forum is a glorious trainwreck

22:01 < Scizor300> being hated on the TO forums is just hilarious because it usually stems from having a different opinion
22:01 < Scizor300> you don't even have to purposely troll there to be hated
22:01 <@Marketh> Being hated on the TO forums is too easy to be funny or impressive
22:01 <@Marketh> I think I'm maturing or something. Seeing trolls and idiots on the internet no longer really amuses me. :(
22:02 < Hope_Estheim1> Yes, because it has nothing to do with the presentation of an opinion or the fact that it's kind of an assault on a thread.  It'd be like if I went to a Pony forum calling out Fluttershy out of spite instead of discussing my opinion in an appropriate thread environment.

22:04 < Fluttershy> what
22:04 <@Marketh> You don't get to complain about accidental highlights
22:04 < Fluttershy> What?
22:04 < Fluttershy> I didn't get highlighted at all.
22:04 <@Marketh> Using a name that appears in a popular TV show is your own fault
22:04 <@Marketh> Then what are you complaining about
22:04 <@Marketh> lol
22:04 < Fluttershy> Because Det always thinks I am people I'm not ._.
22:04 < Hope_Estheim1> To be fair Marketh, I highlight him on purpose all the time.  Also, I was referring to this channel's Fluttershy, because I know he visits other forums.
22:04 < Fluttershy> I don't get any highlights from him.
22:04 < Fluttershy> Since I disabled that.
22:05 < Fluttershy> ... I write on, like, 3 forums, Hope_Estheim1.
22:05 < Fluttershy> Or "wrote" rather
22:05 < Fluttershy> I've never posted on a forum on a regular bases.

15:15 < Hope_Estheim> Is that why you use XChat on your iPhone, because you are a hooligan?
15:16 < Luna> Fluttershy is a HOOLIGAN!
15:16 < Fluttershy> I don't like coffee, I've never been described as "hip" and have no idea what that really means, I have never worn a scarf, and what the hell is a murse?
15:16 < Hope_Estheim> Fluttershy is a menace to society, a tool of the machine.
15:16 < Fluttershy> WAIT
15:16 < Fluttershy> Let's clarify something:
15:16 < Hope_Estheim> He is socially engineered.
15:16 < Fluttershy> I DON'T HAVE XCHAT ON MY IPHONE?
15:17 < Fluttershy> I have Colloquy as my mobile device's IRC client. :|
15:17 < Fluttershy> I wonder if Textual works on iPhones, though. :|
15:17 < Hope_Estheim> Fluttershy you can't be a brony and an apple fanboy at the same time.
15:17 < Fluttershy> That… makes no sense.
15:18  * Fluttershy is simply happy he has a new client that works better than Colloquy to use on his Mac side.
15:19 < Luna> Fluttershy why are you using ellipses
15:19 < Fluttershy> ...
15:19 < Hope_Estheim> Fluttershy you're not emo are you?
15:19 < Hope_Estheim> Only emo people use elipses.
15:19  * Fluttershy goes to disable highlights from Luna and Hope_Estheim. :|
15:19 < Fluttershy> Now that you mention it
15:19 < Fluttershy> I only wear black
15:19 < Fluttershy> and think the vast majority of everything sucks
15:19 < Hope_Estheim> He just admitted to forgetting to turn off highlights from me.
15:19 < Fluttershy> OH DEAR CELESTIA
15:19 < Fluttershy> I might be emo.
15:20 < Luna> Fluttershy: you know I highlight people a ton when talking to them right?
15:20 < Fluttershy> lololol
15:20 < Hope_Estheim> Do you have eyesight problems?  Try pulling the hair away from your right eye.
15:20 < Fluttershy> Luna: It's appropriate during conversations. :P
15:20 < Hope_Estheim> No, your other right.
15:20 < Fluttershy> Wait
15:20 < Fluttershy> Highlight me in a few seconds
15:20 < Fluttershy> ...
15:21 < Fluttershy> what do you think "a few seconds" is?
15:21  * Hope_Estheim operates on Valve Time
15:21 < Fluttershy> … bastards
15:21 < Luna> I'm terrible at counting seconds
15:21 < Fluttershy> Hope_Estheim: Please highlight me. :P
15:22  * Fluttershy hasn't disabled highlights. He's trying to see what highlights look like on channels he's not viewing at the moment
15:22 < Theodis> How on earth do you emote that?
15:22 < Hope_Estheim> You emote it while on Earth.
15:22 < Fluttershy> Emote what, Theodis?
15:22 < Mew> FLUTTERSHY CAME FROM LEFT FIELD AND RAN INTO THE IN FIELDER.
15:22 < Fluttershy> Mother-fucking thank you.

22:41 < Fluttershy> Hi: What he said :P
22:42 < Fluttershy> The game isn't in development, and there's three good reasons it was never for Mac:

22:46 < Fluttershy> I mean, if they don't have a Windows license it's a waste of time and the license is, what, $80+?
22:46 < Fluttershy> But if they already have one they can use
22:46 < Fluttershy> … they might as well use it.

10:09 < r543Blitzsonic> but it sometimes takes time until they answer
10:09 < Leo> red alert we have a noob in the house
10:09 < Leo> :D
10:10 < Andrio> oh, miclealfp isn't here :)
10:10 < Andrio> michaelfp*
10:11 < Leo> .
10:11 < Leo> andrio can u give me a admanite sword
10:12 < Andrio> I don't have it any more
10:12 < Andrio> I used it to craft the Excalibur
10:12 < Leo> thats what im trying to do
10:12 < Andrio> Can't you make your own adamantite sword?
10:12 < Luna> adamantite is pretty hard to find
10:13 < Leo> what she said
10:13 < Leo> also thats why were fighting the destroyer
10:13 < Andrio> I found quite a bit by searching just above the Underworld with a Spelunker Potion.
10:14 < Andrio> also, smash a lot of demon altars
10:14 < Leo> i did that
10:14 < Leo> i have a freaking chest full of spelunker potions
10:15 < Andrio> luckier than me :(
10:15 < Luna> ooh, a spelunker potion
10:15 < Andrio> I only have about 8 left
10:15 < Leo> and still find nothing :(
10:15 < Luna> never thought of that
10:15 < Andrio> lol
10:15 < Luna> remember how I never use buffs?
10:15 < Andrio> Why not?
10:15 < Leo> what do u mean 8 minutes left
10:16 < Andrio> 8 potions
10:16 < Andrio> I use buffs. They're great.
10:16 < Luna> because I'm oldschool and played before they existed and I also don't actually know how to grow the ingredients
10:16 < Leo> oh i can give you some of mine
10:17 < Leo> someone liked alpha alot
10:17 < Leo> for terraria
10:17 < Andrio> I played before they existed too.
10:17 < Andrio> when the Corruption music was the same as the Dungeon music
10:18 < Leo> dungoen music is hell music
10:18 < Andrio> yeah
10:18 < Andrio> And Blood Moon music.
10:19 < Leo> i can give some of mine spelunker potions
10:19 < Luna> eerie is the best music for corruption
10:19 < Leo> i like corruption 1.1 music better
10:20 < Andrio> I think the Eerie theme is pretty awesome
10:20 < Andrio> As are Boss 1, Boss 2, the jungle and, well, most of the others :)
10:21 < Leo> andrio do you know when your going to playing terraria
10:21 < Andrio> no
10:21 < Leo> k

10:31 < Andrio> cool
10:31 < Leo> i use spelunker potoins
10:31 < Andrio> I got a red hat from the clothier the other day.
10:31 < Andrio> Then the other clothier bought it back from me for 20 silver
10:32 < Leo> also whenever i do some how a voodo demon kills him self and his voodo doll lands in the freaking lava
10:33 < Andrio> :|
10:33 < Luna> lol
10:33 < Leo> i do manage to kill the wall of flesh with melle
10:33 < Andrio> That's why you want to be careful around those demons
10:33 < Andrio> Or grab the doll in mid air :)

10:46 < Andrio> do you have a cobalt naginata?
10:46 < Leo> no
10:46 < Leo> why
10:46 < Andrio> Or a mythril... halberd, I think it's called.
10:46 < Andrio> You should make one
10:46 < Andrio> and use it on the Destroyer
10:46 < Leo> why
10:47 < Andrio> because it can hit several segments at once and do a lot of damage.
10:47 < Leo> ………………………
10:47 < Leo> i thought you and i were going to do it
10:48 < Andrio> well, sorry, but I don't know what sort of time I'll have

11:34 < Leo> i was preety happy until i got killed by werewolves and a blood moon
11:34 < Andrio> It took me like four attempts to kill the WoF
11:35 < Andrio> I like full moons. Because then I can turn into a werewolf and duel other werewolves :P
11:35 < Leo> i dont have the charm yet

20:36 < Hope_Estheim> Yo.
20:36 < Itsakaru> Oi
20:36 < Itsakaru> Oh, how delightful. My patch for Deus Ex finished.
20:36 < Hope_Estheim> Which one?  1 or 3?
20:37 < Itsakaru> Human Revolution
20:37 < Hope_Estheim> I need to go back to trying to beat 1.
20:37 < Itsakaru> Typically, I try to play a series from the beginning
20:38 < Itsakaru> But since this is Square Enix we're talking about, it really doesn't matter.
20:38 < Hope_Estheim> Human Revolution is a prequel and it doesn't really spoil DX1 much unless you already know to begin with.
20:39 < Itsakaru> Hm. Makes sense.
20:39 < Itsakaru> I'm debating whether I want to play Deus Ex or Ys when it finishes downloading.
20:43 < Itsakaru> Do you know if there has been any general release date for Starbound?
20:43 < Hope_Estheim> I don't really care about Starbound so no.
20:46 < Itsakaru> Hm. Okidoki.

15:56 < ballstothemetal> how is the mac development coming
15:57 < Zekka> If I'm not mistaken, Terraria is not under official development for Mac OS.
15:57 < Zekka> You'd be best served finding one of the unofficial wrappers that uses Monogame, although these are often glitchy or incomplete
15:57 < ballstothemetal> Will it? Because I purchased it and own a mac, so basically youve stolen my money
15:58 < ballstothemetal> didnt say its only pc when i bought it
15:58 < Zekka> It might have been wise to check whether it ran on mac before purchasing it, although I realize that's a problem.
15:58 < ballstothemetal> i can run roller coaster tycoon with a wine skin thing my friend gave me, could that also work for terraria?
15:59 < Zekka> Wine may work.

15:41 < Scizor300> learning by experience is the best way, but getting tips always helps
15:42 < Da_Wrecka> It comes in handy for other games, though, but it's very handy for Terraria.

16:49 < Da_Wrecka> As in, if you've got Hermes/Spectre Boots and Hallowed Armour, do you go faster than someone with boots alone, or do you just hit top speed before them?

18:14 < Fluttershy> Used to have 80-100 users - I'm actually surprised there's even 50 in here.

18:15 < Fluttershy> And those faggots should stop usin- oh hey you're on IronDust! \o/

19:42 < Hope_Estheim> "- It'll have a fucking PAUSE MENU" - Fail.
19:42 < Scizor300> amazing considering terraria never had an actual pause menu all the way through development
19:43 < Hope_Estheim> In single player you can set it to pause the game whenever you press escape.
19:43 < Scizor300> even though i'm pretty sure it was shoved down red's throat during beta testing
19:43 < Scizor300> hope, an actual pause menu
19:43 < Scizor300> so you don't have to actually exit the world to edit settings
19:43 -!- Khfan [~webchat@k-53-19-66-113.hsd5.md.comcast.net] has joined #terraria
19:43 < Scizor300> like a, you know, normal game
19:44 < Hope_Estheim> So less of a pause menu and more of being able to access options in-game.
19:44 < Scizor300> aka an actual pause menu

23:03 < dalv> Hi :) can i play terraria for free?
23:04 < Marketh> Buy it on Steam
23:04 < Hope_Estheim> After you purchase Terraria, there is no subscription or microtransactions you have to pay for.  It's free after you purchase it.
23:04 < dalv> oh great
23:05 < dalv> is it like a virtual world? can i meet and chat with random people while building/fighting?
23:05 < Marketh> It's not an MMO, so no
23:05 < Marketh> but you can host servers
23:05 < Marketh> which many people can join
23:05 < Hope_Estheim> It's not completely random, you have to either set up a gameplay session with friends, or find a server to connect to.
23:06 < dalv> oh i seee
23:06 < dalv> sound pretty fun though. like minecraft
23:06 < Marketh> indeed
23:07 < dalv> would you guys recommend me a good MMO like... second life but that doesnt require too much in graphics?
23:07 < Hope_Estheim> I wouldn't recommend Second Life to anybody, not even furries.

18:57 < Hope_Estheim> Lol.  Looks like a flash game.
18:57 < Da_Wrecka> looks like Terraria: Flash version
18:58 < Hope_Estheim> Why is this on steam and not freeonlinegames.com?
18:58 < Hope_Estheim> Don't go to freeonlinegames.com
18:58 < Hope_Estheim> I don't know if it's a real site
18:58 < Da_Wrecka> in fairness, it's not on Steam /yet/
18:58 < Nyx> Greenlight thing
18:58 < Hope_Estheim> And if it is, whether it's safe to visit.
18:58 < Nyx> If it gets enough upvotes, it'll be available on Steam
18:58 < Nyx> I really doubt it'll get that many though, since there's already Terraria on Steam.
18:58 < Hope_Estheim> So who wants to make a thread on Terraria finally being updated, and link to this?
18:59 < Hope_Estheim> Please say no so I know nobody has already done so.
19:00 < Hope_Estheim> Ah screw it.
19:04 < Hope_Estheim> Luna give me money.
19:05 < Luna> I need to buy a ps vita

21:25 < Andrio|Work> btw, Nightmare, what's the command for that?

21:28 < Andrio|Work> still, what's the command?
21:29 < Nightmare> /set irc_no_hilight <nicks here>
21:30 < Nightmare> But you have to put all nicks on your no highlight list there

06:06 < IAMKORMAC> You really would.
06:06 < The_Daily_Gamer> yup
06:06 < Luna> do people actually do PvP in minecraft
06:06 < Luna> the combat system is so horrible
06:07 < The_Daily_Gamer> true

06:10 < IAMKORMAC> viktir: The reason why you shouldn't randomly express superiority in Minecraft PVP is that I don't even own Minecraft.
06:10 < SuperBear> Oic
06:10 < SuperBear> Random fact: SuperBear leveled up recently
06:10 < Luna> THEY'RE GOOOOOOONE

07:08 < Luna> terraria doesn't really need hacks, just use an inventory editor
07:08 < Luna> you could cheatenginge item, health, and mana amounts
07:10 < Hope_Estheim8> Luna: What is it about me that makes me like Vriska?

09:58 < Nightmare> what the fuck is a dmg
09:58 < Begging4MacVersion> Mac
09:58 < Nightmare> ok
09:58 < Begging4MacVersion> Duh
09:58 < Nightmare> rud
09:59 < Andrio> Terraria's not going to be on mac.
09:59 < Andrio> Sorry.
09:59 < Begging4MacVersion> Why?
09:59 < Luna> C#
09:59 < Andrio> The language it was coded in is Windows specific.
10:00 < Andrio> I think there are third party programs that can run Terraria on Macs though...
10:00 < Begging4MacVersion> i know people who have coded it to mac but they have only got 1.0.6 :(
10:00 < Nightmare> Google 'Terraria Mac wrapper'
10:00 < Andrio> ^
10:00 < Begging4MacVersion> i got 1 but it is 1.0.6
10:00 < Begging4MacVersion> and it isn't getting updated

10:01 < Begging4MacVersion> and you cant be female or host servers or go on servers
10:01 < Begging4MacVersion> it is a bug for the wrapper
10:01 < Luna> if you get the latest version you can run that with the wrapper
10:01 < Luna> er
10:01 < Luna> or there was another wrapper
10:02 < Begging4MacVersion> i could always download another one

21:09 < Nightmare> Some guy on the internet called me a 'noob' and said 'fuck you' to me.
21:10 < Hope_Estheim> He doesn't deserve respect, and will probably be a guest star on Dr. Phil.
21:10 < DarkAceZ> :P
21:11 < Nightmare> But it still hurt my feelings. :(
21:12 < Hope_Estheim> It might be easier for me to ask what would make you feel better.
21:14 < Nightmare> I want him to come back so I can tell him what a meanie, poopyface he is. :(
21:14 < Hope_Estheim> I can't do that.
21:15  * Nightmare leaves to cut herself.
21:16 < DarkAceZ> wait
21:16 < DarkAceZ> he might come back
21:16 < Hope_Estheim> That was a driveby trolling, he's not coming back.

12:01 < Nightmare> Hello and welcome to 'IronDust is derpy'
12:11 < phillipsjk> I assume the TL;DR of the farewell thread is that: you need Steam to play the game, no the source code is not being released.
12:16 < Nightmare> Pretty much.
12:19 < phillipsjk> A friend want me to play, but I don't run Windows, and don't have Video hardware supporting pixel shading.
12:19 < phillipsjk> Not sure how much of a slowdown rendering is software would incur.

16:10 < phillipsjk> Depends on the license I have not been able to find.
16:15 < Da_Wrecka> As ridiculous an idea as it is, I kinda wonder how much work it would be to port Terraria to Xbox
16:16 < Theodis> Probably mostly a matter of setting up a control scheme and working with limited hardware resources :P
16:17 < phillipsjk> XNA is an XBox framework, apparently.
16:19 < Theodis> It's just Microsoft's .NET frontend for DirectX which is their set of gaming related hardware APIs.  So yeah going to be used in anything Microsoft related.
16:21 < Da_Wrecka> Kinda why I thought it might be interesting.
16:22 < Da_Wrecka> On the one hand, a straight port wouldn't be that tricky.
16:22 < Da_Wrecka> On the other hand, an Xbox has a lot less RAM than most gaming PCs.
16:22 < Da_Wrecka> (shit, my gaming PC has 32x the RAM I'm led to believe is in my Xbox)
16:22 < Theodis> I have no XBox so zero interest from me :P.
16:23 < Melchior> oh hey wrecka
16:23 < Theodis> Proper linux support would be nice though.
16:23 -!- Melchior is now known as Gabranth123
16:27  * Da_Wrecka would expect Linux support to be... difficult to pull off, given Redmond's dislike of competition
16:27 < Theodis> A number of .NET/XNA games have ported to Linux and other non microsoft platforms with Monogame and mono.
16:28 < Da_Wrecka> oh, so it's been done already?
16:28 -!- TheVoid [~odiv@user/TheVoid] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
16:28  * Da_Wrecka wonders how much gnashing of teeth was done at Redmond over that
16:28 < Theodis> Yeah Bastion did it and recently just released their fork of Monogame they used to get it to work.
16:28 < Theodis> And Atom Zombie Smasher
16:29 < Theodis> And a few other games that got ported for the Indie Humble Bundles I think
16:29 < Theodis> It's also used to get .NET stuff to run on android and iOS.
16:30 < Theodis> Well some people think it's Microsoft's latest dirty trick to attack Linux.
16:30 < Theodis> Because they're supporting the mono project with a goofy license.

02:20 < Hope_Estheim> No.
02:21 < Luna> I was playing pyrce and I actually killed people by using the ladel to knock them out, then cutting them up when they were unconscious
02:21 < Luna> ladel is totally overpowered
02:22 < Hope_Estheim> This is why I graduated from Pyrce High, because I don't want to die.

09:19 <@Marketh> lol
09:19 <@Marketh> he sad
09:20 < Gabranth123> well so am I, I think most of us just come here out of habit
09:21 <@Marketh> i'm still glad terraria ended when it did
09:21 < Nightmare> It was for the best
09:21 < Nightmare> before the channel went to complete shit
09:22 < Gabranth123> why, Mark?
09:23 <@Marketh> had this conversation so many times before  :(
09:23 <@Marketh> basically the game would need to be totally rewritten for anything actually *new* to be added
09:24 <@Marketh> or at least hugely rewritten to add anything majorly new
09:24 <@Marketh> Otherwise it would just be new enemies... That attack the same way, spawn the same way... Bosses, that spawn and attack the same way. Loot that... Do the same thing we've already gotten
09:24 <@Marketh> Basically, anything "new" would actually just be reskinned
09:24 < Gabranth123> well I'm afk when you said that before then, most of the time it's brony fapping or dumb noobs asking dumb shit
09:25 < Gabranth123> and yeah I guess
09:25 <@Marketh> I'm glad Terraria ended when it did because now it gives Redigit the chance to start on a new game that, hopefully, will improve upon terraria
09:25 <@Marketh> in a way that gives him the choice of adding actual GAME CHANGING updates
09:25 < Gabranth123> that's kinda what they're having to do with FF14...rebuild the game literally from the ground up to be like a proper mmo instead of "FF11 with pretty graphics"
09:25 <@Marketh> Not updates that just add new weapons and mobs that do all the same shit that we've already seen before
09:30 < Gabranth123> I'm kinda feeling like I'm at the end of my rope with the game
09:30 < Gabranth123> unless I just start doing crazy shit with it for whatever reason

17:56 < DarkAceZ> at least once a week :P
17:57 < DarkAceZ> I lost Terraria a while ago when my harddrive went bad
17:59 < nammfoodle> well my server's special because I'm doing my best to get rid of the "badge of honor" mentality that comes along with getting privileges like moderator.
17:59 < nammfoodle> at least that's my pitch. mileage may vary.

08:47 < Andrio> I don't. That's my goal at the moment :)
08:47 < Andrio> I don't think there's a straight-out 'best' weapon; lots of weapons are really good against different enemies
08:47 < jonathan10zx> :(
08:48 < Andrio> like, the Magical Harp and Dao of Pow work very well on the Destroyer
08:48 < Andrio> The Excalibur not so much
08:48 < jonathan10zx> :( thats what i have
08:49 < Andrio> well, I think it's very good on things like demon eyes which are hard to hit with other weapons

08:53 < jonathan10zx> any one got a server i can get on :D im forever alone

08:54 < jonathan10zx> :P k
08:55 < xPi> http://imgur.com/gallery/vGuXc
08:55 < Andrio> So... when I spawn 200 mimics in my sky arena with rows of wood platforms in it, and just stand under them and stab repeatedly...
08:56 < xPi> farm all the mimic loots
08:56 < Andrio> It's cheating though.
08:57 < Andrio> and I have all the mimic drops legit anyway.
08:57 < Andrio> Then there's the about 5 platinum coins...
09:00 < xPi> I've heard the 5.x range is being used by some russian ISPs now

07:57 < Andrio> what is it?
07:57 < Accudio> When I start it through steam, it seems like it's starting, says "preparing terraria" says I'm playing it, but then acts like I've quit it (goes to online to friends)
07:57 -!- metelkow [~webchat@oug79-950-413-942.pppoe.avangarddsl.ru] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
07:57 < Accudio> But never opens, no errors, nothing
07:57 < PasiB> I like to install terraria server, but not on a windows, on a linux.
07:58 < PasiB> Does anyone have experience in it?
07:58 -!- TheVoid [~odiv@user/TheVoid] has quit [Quit: lol i quit ur net]
07:58 < Andrio> It may well be possible, but my server's on Windows, so I can't help you with that.
07:59 < PasiB> Oh, ok. Thank you nevertheless.
08:01 < Andrio> Accudio, do you know if you have XNA framework installed?

08:03 < Accudio> I don't think I do, but It worked about 5 months ago, but haven't played it since.
08:03 < Accudio> No, I have it
08:07 < Andrio> well, I'm not sure what else would cause Terraria to shut itself down like that
08:08 < Andrio> although I did have a problem whereby Terraria crashed immediately after the 1.1 update because the resolution was set too high for my PC to handle
08:08 < Andrio> I got an 'out of memory' error, so that doesn't seem to fit here
08:09 < Accudio> I've read in some furms of people with the same problem, some have fixed it by modifying the permissions on certain XNA franework folders, but my permissions all seemed good.
08:09 < Accudio> *forums
08:11 < Accudio> Also starting the .exe in the steam program files doesn't seem to do anything when it should tell you to open in steam right?

11:54 -!- Suwako [~Moriya@213.184.gkn.xyq] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
11:54 < Gabranth234> depends.  are you going to ask about servers or where to get the game? :p
11:55 < LotusMorph> Umm, I'm just on this server to talk about Terraria etc.
11:55 < Gabranth234> then I'm good. :p
11:55 < LotusMorph> Ooookayyy?
11:55 < LotusMorph> I guess...
11:56 < Gabranth234> I'm going to level with you
11:56 < Gabranth234> this channel is dead
11:56 < Gabranth234> freenode server and #starbound might be better for your purposes.
11:56 < Gabranth234> since most of us are there now and it's more active
11:56 < LotusMorph> Yeah....sure...
11:56 < Gabranth234> just trying to help, man.
11:56 < LotusMorph> Sorry, i'm a bit confused, what's going on?
11:57 < Gabranth234> Okay, I'll explain it slowly.
11:57 < Gabranth234> Terraria has stopped development.
11:57 < LotusMorph> Why?
11:57 < Gabranth234> Most people have quit coming here, so it's basically us stragglers and people coming in asking stupid questions.  And, very occasionally, honest seekers like you.
11:57 < Gabranth234> Redigit decided to stop.
11:57 < LotusMorph> Thanks?
11:57 < Gabranth234> long story.
11:58 < Gabranth234> Tiy is working on a new game called Starbound.
11:58 < LotusMorph> So, Terraria is basically dead?
11:58 < Gabranth234> So that channel is hoppin'
11:58 < Gabranth234> so you can find lots of people to talk about Terraria with in that channel.
11:58 < LotusMorph> Terraria was doing so well.
11:58 < LotusMorph> And they just stopped...
11:59 < Gabranth234> Dude, for the most part, in the old days, games just came out without any further development.
11:59 < LotusMorph> And didn't think of us...
11:59 < Gabranth234> that we got any at all with Terraria is gravy.
11:59 < Gabranth234> ...
11:59 < Gabranth234> well, one can dispute how Redigit handled things
11:59 < Gabranth234> but he was well within his rights to quit.
12:00 < LotusMorph> He could of atleast made it open-source or sell it to someone else.
12:00 < Svitkona> i don't think it's obfuscated, is it
12:00 < Gabranth234> also
12:00 < LotusMorph> Listening....
12:00 < Gabranth234> I've seen it argued
12:00 < Gabranth234> that it was impossible to really develop further on it, thanks to the limitations of the engine.
12:00 < Gabranth234> he would have had to remake the game from scratch to do anymore.
12:01 < LotusMorph> Was it because it was a 2D sidescroller and computers were just too advance?
12:02 < Gabranth234> what?
12:02 -!- Emurus [~webchat@dxnq-11-713-701-733.washdc.east.verizon.net] has joined #terraria
12:02 < LotusMorph> Because computers within the 21st centuary are way to advanced to handle a 2D sidescroller.
12:03 < Gabranth234> I don't think that was it.
12:03 < Gabranth234> he probably just didn't think big enough when he made the engine
12:03 < Gabranth234> so he ended up hitting the limits of it
12:03 < Gabranth234> kinda like what happened with Final Fantasy 14.
12:03 < LotusMorph> I mean, look at Minecraft, Notch can be a bit of an idiot now and again but he wouldn't stop development just like that.
12:04 < Gabranth234> somehow they had the bright idea that anyone wanted FF11 with pretty graphics, and they ended up having to rebuild the game from scratch to be more like a proper mmo and more easy to develop on.

12:04 < LotusMorph> Because he is thinking of us. Now I kind of get what your saying but... that's harsh.
12:05 < Fluttershy> lolwhat'sthis?
12:05 < Fluttershy> [11:57:14] <LotusMorph> So, Terraria is basically dead?
12:05 < Fluttershy> yes
12:06 < Emurus> But is it really?
12:06 < LotusMorph> Apparently so.
12:06 < Emurus> That's what they want you to think!
12:06 < Fluttershy> You're free to play it, but yes.
12:06  * Gabranth234 tags Fluttershy
12:06 < Gabranth234> I'm done with this.
12:06 < Fluttershy> I'm going to figure out more scripting. Or get lunch.
12:06 < LotusMorph> Good grief...
12:06 < Fluttershy> AND I'M GOING TO REMEMBER I HAVE CLASS IN 50 MINUTES
12:06 < Fluttershy> time to grab lunch
12:06 < Gabranth234> damnit.
12:07 < Emurus> So do you guys know what the Facebook page is doing?
12:07 < Fluttershy> wtf
12:07 < Emurus> LUNCH FTW!
12:07 < Svitkona> lunch?
12:08 < Svitkona> lunch.

09:39 < Luksaman> lol
09:39 < hardwire> porting is big news? lol

09:40 < hardwire> there is no update
09:40 < iris010> and it seems to be pretty quiet here lol
09:40 < Alec5h> I'm aware what the "update" was
09:41 < hardwire> ah. i think terraria is done. i have been following this game http://www.starforge.com/
09:41 -!- iris486 [~webirc@oi72-037-517-512.mc.at.cox.net] has joined #terraria
09:41 < Alec5h> What about starbound..
09:41 < iris486> There should be no hate! BE EXCITED! WOO~
09:41 < hardwire> http://playstarbound.com/ not bad as well
09:41 < Alec5h> And join the Odyssey pvp group on steam, Terraria isn't completely dead
09:41 < iris010> i'll only be excited if they release the "new content" to PC too
09:42 < hardwire> that last big update for terraria was great! more content like that needs to keep flowing or games like this will become monotonous
09:42 < Luksaman> New content may be anything.
09:42 < OnyxT> check http://galaxy55.com/ as well <- sci fi minecraft with round planets!

09:42 < iris010> yeah i wouldnt be surprised if it was just small stuff that isnt related to the PC anyway
09:42 < iris486> Either way, WOO.
09:43 < Alec5h> Have you played starforge?
09:43 < iris486> I just hope it has 4-player COOP.
09:43 < hardwire> star forge should be sweet, good graphics minecraft with guns and vehicles and u can go into space
09:43 < Alec5h> Its not out yet?
09:43 < OnyxT> the question is - when the pc version will get the updates? no point teasing people if it is gonna be next year right?
09:43 < hardwire> star forge is still in the developing stage, you can play but it is basic right now
09:44 < iris010> you would think if it was gonna be on PC then they would just say that

09:53 < Alec5h> Well not guaranteed PC updates.
09:54 < XboxLiveTerraria> Well it's good news for me, it's coming on xbox, and i havn't  got the best of computer to run it
09:54 < Alec5h> They'll likely update it, but I'll be damned if they dont
09:54 < XboxLiveTerraria> They will don't worry
09:54 < iris010> i wish they would just announce it then
09:54 < XboxLiveTerraria> It takes a long time to do anything on a game
09:54 < Alec5h> I wonder what the updates are?
09:55 < XboxLiveTerraria> New biomes?
09:55 < XboxLiveTerraria> NPS?
09:55 < XboxLiveTerraria> NPCS*
09:55 < iris215> mostlickly new vanaty clothing
09:55 < XboxLiveTerraria> Still cool
09:55 < OnyxT> quote from eurogamer: "The one-man band that made Terraria originally, Andrew Spinks, doesn't appear to be directly involved,"
09:56 < XboxLiveTerraria> Anything added to a game is cool, as long as they don't take away stuff
09:56 < OnyxT> the port is a "courtesy of 505 Games and developer Engine Software."

13:44 < Beachil> because people are ungrateful./
13:44 < Beachil> I paid 5 pounds for a game that I have played for over 300 hours and I am still not bored of the game, how can people slate Redigit for this?
13:44 < Beachil> he's done a fine job
13:44 < FrostPegg> Very true. Entitlement is the biggest problem with modern gamers.

13:45 < Beachil> Redigit owed us nothing, he could have left Terraria as the unfinished game it was when it was released in may 2011

14:55 < Yoshibrothers> Hi there
14:57 < ExDec> Are the rumours about devs leaving PC version devlopement true? Because I love this game and it's sad for me to hear that.
15:00 < Nientiendo> ExDec
15:00 < Nientiendo> it was cancelled like
15:00 < Nientiendo> 6 months ago
15:00 < Nientiendo> but
15:00 < Nientiendo> it will probably continue
15:00 < Nientiendo> considering
15:00 < Nientiendo> the game's getting ported
15:02 < ExDec> I haven't followed Terraria news (now let's laugh about this for 10 minutes) so I didn't know that. I think that's just sad... If you make something you should continue updating it after some while (not every week but at least once in a year).

07:05 < r543Blitzsonic> someone should rather hack the .exe and replace the english words, that would be a lot better than the language select

07:07 -!- DjShadFox [~webirc@212.41.tu.iuo] has joined #terraria
07:08 < Vamp> it is so stupid, that the respec from that goblin guy, doesn't work in the multilanguage version. Only if you have set Terraria in english, it will work
07:10 < r543Blitzsonic> that's because the multilanguage thing was never really 100% tested
07:10 < r543Blitzsonic> so play it in English if you want to have the most glitch-free version

07:13 < Vamp> I think the community should make a Terraria 1.1.3, so that the game should be 100% bug and glitch free.
07:15 < Gabranth234> while I agree that I'd like to see bugs fixed even if no further development happens, it's impossible to be 100 percent bug and glitch free.
07:15 < Gabranth234> best that can be done I think is to get rid of the game breaking ones.
07:18 < DjShadFox> Redegit - developing PC-version? fuck no. Porting on consoles? OH YEAH, BABY!
07:18 < Gabranth234> wut
07:19 < DjShadFox> just slowpoke rage.
07:20 < Vamp> No it is not Regedit, it is 505games they make the port.
07:20 < Gabranth234> are you saying Redigit is making something for consoles?
07:22 < DjShadFox> "I can’t say how excited I am to finally have Terraria come to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3! To see it come so far is a complete shock, especially after such humble beginnings. It’s always been my dream to have as many people as possible know and enjoy Terraria as much as I have, and this is another big step in that direction! It’s been awesome working with 505 Games, and I can’t wait for everyone to see the additional features that they’ve been

12:57 < brianjim> lets do a multiplayer minecraft

13:06 < andry> uhh... who buyed here terraria?
13:06 < brianjim> ikjk''''
13:06 < Da_Wrecka> ...Terraria on Xbox and PS3? This concept makes my brain stop. How would that even work?
13:06 -!- Suwako [~Moriya@213.184.gkn.xyq] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
13:07 <@Marketh> Da_Wrecka, it would work. The question is how well it would work
13:07 <@Marketh> Trying to move a cursor with an analogue stick to build and mine would be... Rather frustrating, I imagine
13:07 < brianjim> i da nou
13:07 < andry> Minecraft can work on Xbox, Super Meat Boy can work on xbox sooo
13:07 <@Marketh> andry, these games are entirely different
13:07 < brianjim> nova
13:07 <@Marketh> Terraria uses small blocks
13:07 < Da_Wrecka> My point exactly... Minecraft you can see, because it's first-person and you can still mine that way.
13:07 <@Marketh> trying to accurately target a block to mine, or to target where you want to place a block will be extremely irritating
13:07 < Da_Wrecka> But Terraria is 2D and mouse-driven, how is that going to be translated to twinsticks?
13:08 <@Marketh> because analogue sticks don't have the accuracey of using a mouse
13:08 < andry> hmm...
13:08 < andry> bigger blocks? :D
13:08 <@Marketh> For Minecraft it works because blocks are large, little room for error
13:08 < brianjim> stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111

13:08 < Da_Wrecka> Minecraft, you're using the right stick to aim rather than a mouse - other than that, little changes.

15:00 < Nientiendo> Marketh
15:00 < Nientiendo> i like how
15:00 < Nientiendo> redigit was making so much fuzz
15:00 < Nientiendo> and then he trolled the community
15:00 < Nientiendo> so
15:00 < Nientiendo> hard
15:00 <@Marketh> depends how you look at it, he was hyped over it himself
15:00 <@Marketh> it's a big deal to him, doesn't mean it'll be a big deal to everyone else in the community
15:01 <@Marketh> for what it's worth there are a lot of happy people that it's coming to consoles
15:01 <@Marketh> just, also a large majority who are unhappy
15:02 <@TrinityFlash> "they got me excited for a new update after it was made clear no new updates are gonna be made" isn't a good reason to be pissed or anything
15:03 <@Marketh> To be fair, he did say there would be one last update

16:01 < Blaze102> alright
16:01 < Nientiendo> the only way to speed things up

01:52 <@Marketh> I have him on Steam
01:52 < huru> Ah
01:53 < huru> Was going to say, I wouldn't mind talking to him :s I guess he doesn't care much for irc hah.
01:53 <@Marketh> well
01:53 < Nightmare> he just has a life to deal with etc
01:53 <@Marketh> he used to come to irc frequently, but just not in this channel

01:53 < Nightmare> ikr
01:54 <@Marketh> but yeah I don't see him on steam too often either

01:58 < huru> Andrio: oh real?
01:59 < Andrio> yeah
02:03 < Nurse> huru, this channel is already pretty much dead
02:03 < Nurse> which you know
02:04 < Nurse> getting a spambot, other than the damage from the actual network flood itself, is practically excitement here
02:04 < Nightmare> huru: also, the flags for this channel are messed up for what it's work
02:04 < Nightmare> th
02:04 < Andrio> that wasn't a bot. That was some Mibbit noob
02:05 < huru> aye
02:05 < huru> this is the most activity I have seen on this network in awhile :x
02:05 < huru> probably partially my fault for being so busy.
02:05 < Nightmare> a long time ago Spitfire implemented changes to the flags (removing the staff/* flag, he also gave me +o and Marketh founder along with some other changes)
02:05 < Nightmare> But after bikcmp fucked the db
02:06 < Nightmare> and had to revert to an old one, spitfire was already banned and couldn't rechange things because of it
02:06 < huru> rule 1) always backup your services db
02:06 < Nightmare> ^

20:51 < Yoshibrothers> Look, I've been trying to access #knuxcentral for days. Knowing that I banned myself, I've been asking every op to unban me, but they can't. Then I heard that only founders could unban users, so I asked Knux, and he said to ask Valtteri, but he hasn't been around. So I asked qig, and he told me he might be able to, but never answered back, possibly confirming failiure
20:51 < bikcmp> one question
20:51 < bikcmp> why would you want to be in #knuxcentral
20:52 < Yoshibrothers> Because I go there
20:52 < Yoshibrothers> idk

22:08 < KoburaShinja> I'd have thought TerrariaIRC would have more people
22:09 <@Marketh> It used to
22:09 <@Marketh> A lot of people stopped bothering when development stopped
22:09 < DarkAceZ> Marketh, how many?
22:09 < DarkAceZ> 200?
22:10 <@Marketh> well it used to be closer to that when the game was releasing or updates were due
22:10 <@Marketh> before the announcement of development stopping it used to be around 80 I think?
22:10 <@Marketh> now it's just 49
22:10 < Theodis> Most of which just idle
22:10 <@Marketh> indeed
22:11 < Theodis> Well that was always the case :P
22:11 < KoburaShinja> bugger people like that
22:11 <@Marketh> now it's just lurkers and dupes
22:11 <@Marketh> for whatever reason people need dupes
22:11 < KoburaShinja> And bugger that I only get into it at the end, which if there's GOING to be an end it's better that way
22:11 < KoburaShinja> I don't like my MO changing in the middle of my game
22:12 <@Marketh> there isn't really any objective in the game anyway
22:12 < Theodis> It's interesting to experience the changes in a game.
22:12 < KoburaShinja> like when mojo released the map format change I was all "FUUUUUU" because that basically invalidated my longest-running games
22:13 < Theodis> Doesn't convert old maps for you?
22:13 < KoburaShinja> The seed extrapolation changed
22:13 < KoburaShinja> the maps went haywire in un-generated places
22:13 < KoburaShinja> hills were cut into extreme hills abruptly
22:13 < KoburaShinja> (which was pretty)

11:28 < caitlin> I don't really know anything about your question.
11:28 < caitlin> So I can't answer.
11:28 <@Marketh> bul, doubt you'd find many people here with a server you can play on
11:28 <@Marketh> least of all if it's for a mod
11:29 <@Marketh> I also have no idea what ROTD is
11:30 < bul> ROTD - Retribution of the Darkness
11:31 < bul> ROTD = Retribution of the Darkness
11:31 <@Marketh> yes I got that the first time
11:31 < caitlin> heh

11:32 < bul> here i not can find server?
11:33 <@Marketh> No
11:33 < bul> why?
11:33 < bul> politics or other?
11:33 < caitlin> People don't have a server with the mod
11:33 <@Marketh> Because nobody is hosting a server

01:58 < iris202> hello
01:58 < Andrio> Hi
01:58 < iris202> anyone else having trouble connecting to a friend whos hosting a server?
01:59 < Andrio> No...
01:59 < Andrio> are you?
01:59 < iris202> ya been trying for a couple hours now
01:59 < iris202> cant seem to figure it otu
01:59 < Andrio> Is it hanging on 'Connecting'?
02:00 < iris202> yea
02:00 < Andrio> ok
02:00 < Andrio> what's the server address?
02:00 < iris202> 108.38.116.135
02:02 < Andrio> ' Port 7777 is closed on 108.38.116.135.'
02:02 < iris202> so no one is able to join it?
02:02 < iris202> is there a way to open it?
02:02 < Andrio> No.
02:02 < Andrio> They'll need to port forward it.
02:03 < Andrio> that or use Hamachi.
02:03 < iris202> we have hamachi
02:03 < iris202> is there a quick way to do it with that
02:03 < Andrio> Maybe.
02:03 < Andrio> I'm not familiar with Hamachi though, sorry
02:03 < iris202> its ok no problem
02:04 < Nightmare> If you're not familiar with how to make servers with Hamachi, you should really try to port forward instead
02:04 < iris202> sorry for asking you so many questions
02:04 < Nightmare> It's much cleaner and more secure, in a sense
02:04 < iris202> trying to get all our friends to play
02:04 < iris202> how would he port forward it not too familiar with that..
02:05 < Nightmare> Hm, it depends on what router he has
02:05 < iris202> he has a belakin he said? he has it open but doesnt know what to do
02:05 < Nightmare> iris202: Tell him to lookup his router at http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm and follow the directions there
02:05 < iris202> im sure i butchered the router name
02:06 < iris202> ok where going to check that out right now
02:06 < iris202> thank you so much ill let u know if it works :x
02:06 < Nightmare> Sure, no problem. :D

02:38 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Uoh, y cover is blown!
02:38 < Andrio> ?
02:38 < Neimi_The_Nomad> I think I'm on like 5 IRC networks right now haha. =P
02:38 < Nurse> Only 5?
02:39 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Yeah, I used to go to a lot more, but I left IRC for several years.
02:39 < Neimi_The_Nomad> How many are you on Nurse?
02:40 < Nurse> Five when I'm using this OS, seven to twelve on the OS on my second partition, six to eight on my third partition's OS.
02:40 < Nurse> Still need to partition space for Gentoo one of these days. Too lazy to do it.
02:41 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Do you design web elements or something? I'm trying to wonder why one would need to run three OS's...
02:41 < Nurse> If it's partitioned, it's not running simultaneously without virtualization softwre.
02:41 < Nurse> I run it through my bootmgr.
02:43 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Indeed, however I am just curious as to why you'd use so many different OS's if not for designing web based elements to test it on ect.
02:43 < Nurse> Still trying to wonder, or finally on the wondering stage yet?
02:43 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Still wondering indeed.
02:43 < Nurse> So you've passed the trying to wonder stage. /congratulate
02:43 < Nurse> :P Just pickin' on your grammar.
02:43 < Neimi_The_Nomad> I never was curious as to how it was possible to run three partitions.
02:44 < Nurse> Anyways, I'm a software developer.
02:44 < Neimi_The_Nomad> That was all you had to say. -.-;
02:44 < Nurse> That would be a lame channel.
02:44 < Nightmare> Ick Gentoo :(
02:45 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Pray tell, wouldn't it make life much easier though?
02:45 < Nurse> Take your IRC channels and compress everyone's chats into one or two words.
02:45 < Neimi_The_Nomad> "Hi, bye"
02:45 < Nurse> Limit the messages per hour to one.
02:45 < Neimi_The_Nomad> That's about 90% of all IRC content them two words.
02:46 < Nurse> Nightmare, you got a problem with it?
02:46 < Nurse> roar.
02:46 < Neimi_The_Nomad> *Have you got
02:46 < Nurse> *you got[...]
02:47 < Neimi_The_Nomad> (*....) you got
02:47 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Two can indeed play this game.
02:47 < Nurse> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOPsfaQRcbk
02:47 < Nurse> ^ Your structure. ;)
02:48 < Nightmare> Nurse: Debian and Ubuntu are just in general less... icky
02:48 < Neimi_The_Nomad> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32FB-gYr49Y
02:48 < Neimi_The_Nomad> Your argument. =')
02:48 < Nightmare> + I've heard about Gentoo having lots of sexcurity issues
02:48 < Nightmare> erm, security *
02:48 < Nurse> Nightmare, eh, too high for me.
02:49 < Nurse> and you typed that intentionally.
02:49 < Nurse> EVERY TIME I come around
02:49 < Nurse> EVERY time, I swear
02:49 < Nightmare> I actually didn't, seriously.
02:49 < Nightmare> And no, I don't talk about sex/etc constantly
02:50 < Nurse> Then you have one weird curse.
02:52 < Neimi_The_Nomad> I'm calling sexual repression.

03:56 < Liraxus> So this news about Terraria on consoles
03:57 < Liraxus> They mentioned new content
03:57 < Liraxus> Did they say anything about us PC users getting that content or is it console exclusive.

04:13 < Novatris> Is Terraria dead? like is it ever gonna be updated?
04:14 < Liraxus> P. much.
04:14 < Liraxus> Other than that Console port.
04:14 < Novatris> Are there any modders that'll keep it alive and interesting by adding new items and bosses and whatnot in the game?
04:17 < Novatris> Are the consoles going to have anything new in them once the game comes out on platforms? Will IT be updated constantly?
04:20 < Liraxus> I dunno and i dunno.
04:20 < Liraxus> But yeah, a large following of modders has risen
04:20 < Liraxus> Hell, even i wanna change the game a bit.
04:22 < Novatris> it'd be cool if there was a group of modders that TOGETHER would make awesome new content for the game. Some people that would be ready to update the game constantly should buy the game license from the devs. Could that be possibru?
04:24 < xPi> terrariaonline.com forums, modding section
04:24 < xPi> content is there, kinda doubt it becoming official
04:28 < Liraxus> Really, a lot of mods there aren't that impressive
04:28 < Liraxus> MAYBE the metroid mod
04:28 < Liraxus> But other than that
04:28 < Liraxus> Its not that interesting
04:30 < Liraxus> Aaargh
04:30 < Liraxus> Stupid router
04:30 < Liraxus> Why did you just stop working for me

04:49 < Novatris> Reborn mod is something that i'm looking for. i mean it has new bosses, and new items as well. New ores too. so that kind of stuff i'm looking for
04:51 < Liraxus> Really the bosses that people are making for Terraria just don't fit with its theme.
04:52 < Liraxus> Items are another story, some are actually pretty kickass.
04:52 < Liraxus> But the bosses really aren't as fun at the vanilla ones.
04:54 < Liraxus> Kay, i'm going

09:24 < Nientiendo> this post
09:24 < Nientiendo> Forget about it. It's honestly people trying to sound impressive by saying they have hundreds of hours logged. When there just acting childish. It's like the whole "my dick is bigger then your dick" or "my dads better then your dad" arguments.

10:30 < why4tgf> minecraft 1.3.3 is gonna come out on halloween
10:31 < Andrio> How do you know that?
10:31 < why4tgf> youtube
10:32 < why4tgf> and they added more bosses and zombies can pick up items and some other stuff
10:32 < Andrio> yeah, so the next release will probably be 1.4, not 1.3
10:32 < Andrio> and the command blocks :)

19:10 < Jack> I have an copper helmet!
19:10 < Jack> Already...
19:11 < Yoshibrothers> Its not tough to get copper items, believe it or not
19:16 < Scizor300> it's not tough to get anything
19:16 < Scizor300> it just depends on the time you're willing to put in
19:17 < Yoshibrothers> ^
19:18 < Scizor300> a lot of items, especially in hardmode, involve a metric fuckton of grinding
19:18 < Scizor300> and it will definetly strain your patience the first time around
19:18 < Yoshibrothers> Thats exactly how I got my Excalibur

23:32 < Noobion> anyone in the IRC?
23:35 < Fluttershy> Noobion: Now I am.
23:35 < Fluttershy> Need anything? :|
23:35 < Noobion> yes
23:35 < Fluttershy> not that I can particularly solve problems anyways.
23:35 < Noobion> when exactly does the cavern layer start so i can encounter skeletons
23:35 < DarkAceLaptop> how dafuq do you get good reforges?
23:35 < DarkAceLaptop> all I see is 4%
23:35 < DarkAceLaptop> you never get anything like Godly or Demonic from the tinkerer
23:35 < Noobion> on a large world?
23:36 -!- nilwolf is now known as nilwolf|away
23:36 < Fluttershy> When exactly?
23:36 < Noobion> yeah
23:36 < Noobion> or like an estimate
23:36 < Noobion> at least?
23:36 < Fluttershy> When you see the grey stone background
23:36 < Noobion> ive been digging for a while
23:36 < Fluttershy> that's the "cavern"
23:36 < Noobion> well, good enough i suppose
23:36 < Noobion> i have Dirt with some stone in it
23:36 < Noobion> atm
23:36 < Fluttershy> If you see dirt with some rocks in it, that's not deep enough
23:36 < Noobion> @Darkace - it's just chance
23:36 < Noobion> also
23:36 < Noobion> is there any +dmg to slime weapon?
23:36 < Fluttershy> No :P
23:37 < Noobion> darn.
23:37 < Noobion> whats a good way to find shadow orb?
23:37 < Scizor300> <DarkAceLaptop> how dafuq do you get good reforges? <--- let me introduce you to the wonderful world of "grinding resources for money"
23:37 < Noobion> i need the arms dealer for eye of cthulu
23:37 < DarkAceLaptop> when the underground music play
23:37 < DarkAceLaptop> s
23:37 < Fluttershy> Noobion: To find shadow orbs
23:37 < Fluttershy> go to the corruption :S
23:37 < DarkAceLaptop> Scizor300, I went through 30 plays
23:37 < Noobion> are they found in underground too?
23:37 < Fluttershy> Nope
23:37 < Fluttershy> Only in the corruption
23:38 < Noobion> darn..so no guns until after WoF?
23:38 < DarkAceLaptop> plats//8
23:38 < DarkAceLaptop> **
23:38 < Fluttershy> What?
23:38 < Fluttershy> No
23:38 < Fluttershy> The corruption exists when you create your world
23:38 < Noobion> Where is that?
23:38 < Fluttershy> The WoF spawns when you drop a guide doll in lava in the underworld
23:38 < Fluttershy> Noobion: On the surface
23:38 < Fluttershy> Purpley-evil looking areas.
23:38 < Noobion> i was told when you beat WoF, hallow and corruption are made
23:38 < Noobion> but you have to beat WoF first
23:38 < Fluttershy> Noobion: That is a true statement.
23:39 < Fluttershy> But those are, specifically, hardmode hollow and corruption
23:39 < Noobion> oh, so if i just run around on the surface i can eventually find shadow orb?
23:39 < Fluttershy> Hallow*
23:39 < Fluttershy> Eh
23:39 < Fluttershy> Sort of
23:39 < Fluttershy> They're in chasms in the corruption
23:39 < Fluttershy> Which are deep holes. :|
23:39 < Fluttershy> they're pretty much vertical.
23:39 < Noobion> large, deep chasms
23:39 < Noobion> on surface
23:39 < Fluttershy> Yes
23:39 < Noobion> Horseshoe is found on Sky islands. right?
23:40 < Fluttershy> Yes.
23:40 < Fluttershy> But you can get down if you have blocks/platforms/a grappling hook
23:40 < Fluttershy> (And importantly, you can get back up)
23:40 < Fluttershy> You don't need a grappling hook
23:40 < Fluttershy> it just makes things simple :P
23:40 < Noobion> Ah.
23:40 < Noobion> I just started playing it seriously.
23:41 < Noobion> So...sorry for all the questions haha
23:41 < Noobion> I skimmed over wikia though.
23:41 < Noobion> Also - once you kill guide, he can't respawn, ever, right?
23:42 < Scizor300> all npcs respawn
23:42 < Fluttershy> If you meet the conditions, they will respawn.
23:44 < Noobion> ah.

11:02 < Noobion> OK.
11:02 < Noobion> can i have a link please?
11:02 < Zekka> I hope this doesn't count as advertising - I imagine it wouldn't. They have a webchat at http://playstarbound.com
11:05 < Noobion> thank you

18:32 <@Marketh> By finding somebody who is hosting a server
18:32 < HopelessTerrarian> to download and host it
18:33 <@Marketh> oh
18:33 <@Marketh> I see
18:33 <@Marketh> you download the latest server hosting thing from terraria.org
18:33 <@Marketh> or just look in the games directory in the steam folder
18:33 < HopelessTerrarian> like the dedicated server software
18:33 <@Marketh> What I just said is for the dedicated server software
18:33 < HopelessTerrarian> yeah but thats 1.1.2
18:34 <@Marketh> yes. 1.1.2 is the most recent version
18:34 < HopelessTerrarian> yeah but i want 1.1
18:34 <@Marketh> I think you should update yer game

18:35 < HopelessTerrarian> or want to
18:35 <@Marketh> There's basically no reason to want to update
18:35 <@Marketh> it adds new content, isn't that what every terraria player wants?
18:36 < HopelessTerrarian> true, but my firends and i are running 1.1
18:36 <@Marketh> Then you do not own the game legitimately
18:37 < HopelessTerrarian> no, we just like 1.1 because we want to play together
18:37 < HopelessTerrarian> instead of half of us not being able to play
18:37 <@Marketh> as I said, 1.1.2 adds new content. All you have to do is update and you could then all continue to play together
18:37 < HopelessTerrarian> ok
18:38 < HopelessTerrarian> oh well
18:38 <@Marketh> If you have the game legitimately on steam then it would update itself
18:38 < HopelessTerrarian> yeah but i hate steam

05:02 < Liraxus> Hey
05:02 < Liraxus> Is there any way to play Terraria without an interenet connection?
05:02 < Liraxus> Because i'm headed out to a place without any internet
05:03 < Andrio> Can you start it directly from steamapps?
05:03 < Liraxus> Lemme check
05:03 < Liraxus> If not i think getting a pirated copy could be the solution
05:03 < Liraxus> I already purchased the game so i wouldn't feel guilty
05:04 < Liraxus> Either way, i'm at the worst part in the entire game
05:04 < Andrio> what part is that?
05:04 < Liraxus> Beating the eye and bombing your way through corruption
05:05 < Andrio> I prefer to just dig it up
05:05 < Liraxus> Where you have to fight the EoW who i can't seem to beat at this point
05:05 < Liraxus> I don't have a nightmare pickaxe :V
05:05 < Liraxus> Yo need to beat the EoW to get demon scales and i can't beat that boss yet
05:06 < Liraxus> I tested it from steamapps
05:06 < Liraxus> Looks like it works
05:06 < Andrio> well, a friend of mine actually found the Eye of Cthulhu a fun challenge
05:06 < Liraxus> Yeah, me to
05:06 < Liraxus> Except...
05:06 < Liraxus> NINJA STAR NINJA STAR NINJA STAR
05:07 < Liraxus> Makes the boss a cakewalk
05:07 < Liraxus> And if any tiny eyes get by, i just stab them with my silver sword.
05:08 < Andrio> yeah, those seem very effective
05:09 < Liraxus> Oy...
05:09 < Liraxus> Still
05:09 < Liraxus> That fucking EoW is a pain
05:09 < Andrio> You've got a sword
05:09 < Andrio> use it
05:10 < Andrio> They're good against the EoW
05:10 < Liraxus> A silver sword?
05:10 < Liraxus> A. silver. sword. against the EoW
05:10 < Andrio> well, a gold one would be better
05:10 < Liraxus> Still, it needs to have a large area for me to find it useful
05:10 < Liraxus> And i'm pretty sure you know what i'm talking bout.
05:12 < Liraxus> I wish that the meteorite would hurry the hell up and spawn
05:13 < Liraxus> I'd probably win easily against the EoW with meteor gear
05:16 -!- DarkAceLaptop [~BillyMays@50.107.iu.hvs] has joined #terraria

05:29 < Liraxus> Oh dear god
05:29 < Liraxus> A goblin army
05:29 < Liraxus> I'm in deep shit
05:29 < Liraxus> Ok uh, west is treated like west in this game, correct?
05:29 < Liraxus> Or is east west due to terraria's sun
05:31 < Andrio> I'm pretty sure left relative to the camera is west, contrary to the sun

08:15 < Ranger> I'm clicking terraria but game not running and I haven't error. (Win 7 64bit 4gb ram)
08:16 < Ranger> anyone can help ?
08:21 < Andrio> Do you have XNA framework installed?
08:21 < Ranger> hmm, no, lemme try
08:22 < Ranger> what is it ?
08:22 < Andrio> sort of complicated.
08:22 < Ranger> must I download it for terraria ?
08:23 < Andrio> but you need to have it installed, otherwise Terraria won't work
08:23 < Andrio> It's free from Microsoft
08:23 < Ranger> 1 min, trying to download XNA, I found it on .microsoft.com
08:23 < Ranger> need I restart my PC ?
08:24 < Andrio> I don't think so.
08:24 < Andrio> http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914
08:24 < Ranger> no problem, installed

15:16 < nammfoodle> I just beat the Wall of Flesh and I don't know what the next step is
15:16 < nammfoodle> I tried wyvern hunting so I can make angel wings but I don't think I have the right equipment yet
15:18 < nammfoodle> the dryad says the percentage of corruption/hallow. am I supposed to be trying to eradicate one or both of them?
15:18 -!- MarioE [~MarioE@w26.594.66.07.dynamic.ip.windstream.net] has joined #terraria
15:19 < Eplemosen> well getting rid of any of it is extremely hard as it spreads terribly fast in hardmode
15:20 < nammfoodle> okay, so that's NOT what I'm supposed to be doing
15:20 < nammfoodle> what AM I?
15:20 < Eplemosen> I personally recommend getting the adamantium armor, then start fighting wyverns
15:20 < nammfoodle> where do I find adamantium?
15:21 < Eplemosen> you probably got the pwnhammer from the wall of flesh
15:21 < nammfoodle> yep
15:21 < Eplemosen> using it, you can break demon altars in your world
15:21 < nammfoodle> ooh, smashing them does something?
15:21 < Eplemosen> for each altar you break, more cobalt, mithril or adamantium will be generated in the world

15:22 < nammfoodle> does it summon a monster like smashing shadow orbs does?
15:22 < Eplemosen> some nasty wraiths may spawn just as you break them
15:22 < Eplemosen> so be prepared
15:23 < nammfoodle> those I can handle
15:23 < Eplemosen> good :D
15:23 < nammfoodle> thanks for the help!
15:23 < Eplemosen> no problem
15:25 < china> Eplemosen: i'm jelly of your fiber connection ;_;
15:25 < Eplemosen> china: haha
15:25 < china> i'm on ice.net, and it fucking sucks
15:26 < china> also greetings from a fellow norwegian
15:26 < Eplemosen> go norway :)
15:27 < china> whereabouts do you live?
15:27 < china> inb4 finnmark
15:27 < nammfoodle> is there a way to 'beat' terraria?
15:27 < Eplemosen> saltdal kommune, nordland
15:27 < nammfoodle> like is there a final boss or anything?
15:28 < china> well, nammfoodle. i'd say if you manage to clear the corruption and the hallow, then you've done a very good job
15:28 < Eplemosen> nammfoodle: you may know this, but there are three hardmode bosses plus the wyvern
15:28 < nammfoodle> skeletron prime
15:28 < nammfoodle> mechanical wurm
15:28 < nammfoodle> and something els
15:29 < china> the twins
15:29 < Eplemosen> yes
15:29 < Eplemosen> i'd say the worm is the easiest of the three, and the twins the hardest
15:29 < china> i second that
15:29 < nammfoodle> any way to know where the new ores have spawned?
15:29 < china> and also in the twins fight i would focus on spaz
15:30 < Eplemosen> cobalt spawns pretty much everywhere
15:30 < nammfoodle> am I going to have to re-explore all the mines from before?
15:30 < Eplemosen> mythril a little deeper
15:30 < china> yes, you will
15:30 < nammfoodle> :-(
15:30 < Eplemosen> and adamantium is easiest to find right above hellworld

00:18 < Rizzler> So I wasn't really clear on the information about the platform release of Terraria
00:18 < Rizzler> Are there any updates going to be available at all for PC after the game is released for consoles?
00:18 < Rizzler> As DLC or anything?
00:27 < Andrio> I don't think so. I'm not sure in the details though.

00:28 < Andrio> btw, you can /nick on the webirc client.
00:28 < Rizzler> I know, just didn't want to bother with it
00:28 < Rizzler> Was only using it to get the server address
00:36 < Rizzler> Hrmm
00:36 < Rizzler> Well, I just got this PC a few days ago, lost all my save files and such

09:11 < Andrio> I'd use it for my Terraria server but it crashes all the time :(
09:12 < Andrew> Sounds fun.
09:12 < Andrio> also so I can do this:
09:12 < Andrio> [00:10:45] <@Andrio> !minecraft item diamond

10:28 < Chaser> next time
10:28 < Powersnork> or copy your cousin's game to your pc
10:28 < Chaser> I did it
10:28 < Chaser> it says "stopped working"
10:29 < Chaser> what is the fucking problem ?
10:29 < Powersnork> idk
10:29 < Powersnork> ask ur cousin
10:29 < Andrew> In 20+ years of using computers I can't say I've ever seen an error that just says "stopped working".
10:29 < Chaser> he is at the my near :D
10:30 < Powersnork> andrew, "stopped working" is actually a common windows issuse xD
10:30 < Chaser> my cousin installed something and problem solved
10:30 < Chaser> and forgot its name
10:30 < Andrew> I'm sure it says more than "stopped working". ;)
10:30 < Chaser> in microsoft.com
10:30 < Powersnork> framework?
10:31 < Andrio> XNA?
10:31 < Powersnork> if a program freezes, it says stopped working

12:26 < nammfoodle> I can work on getting adamantite equipment. that's the last ore I haven't gotten.
12:26 < Svitkona> wait nvm
12:26 < Svitkona> i mixed mithril with cobalt
12:26 < nammfoodle> will that really help me that much?
12:27 < Svitkona> i was able to do work with just mythril :/
12:27 < Svitkona> worm*
12:27 < nammfoodle> so maybe I'm doing something wrong? the wurm himself I can dodge pretty well
12:27 < nammfoodle> but the lazers get me
12:28 < Svitkona> what weapon are you using?
12:28 < nammfoodle> green phasesaber
12:28 < nammfoodle> I've got a cobalt repeater too but that doesn't seem very useful
12:28 < Svitkona> hmm
12:29 < Svitkona> if you can get one of those flails i think that might be a better option
12:29 < Svitkona> they can't "pierce" several layers can they?
12:29 < nammfoodle> okay, let me see if I have one on file or if I can craft one or soemthing
12:30 < Svitkona> http://terraria.wikia.com/wiki/Dao_of_Pow
12:30 < Svitkona> this might be a good option if you can farm the souls up
12:30 < Svitkona> or you could use a blue moon, found in dungeons
12:31 < nammfoodle> I've got a demonic Sunfury that deals the same damage as a phasesaber
12:31 < nammfoodle> that's a flail
12:31 < Svitkona> hmm
12:31 < Svitkona> ah
12:31 < Svitkona> yeah
12:31 < Svitkona> that works
12:31 < nammfoodle> still doesn't solve the problem of lasers melting my HP in seconds though
12:31 < Svitkona> potions help loads too
12:32 < Svitkona> hmm
12:32 < nammfoodle> I have literally every potion.

12:32 < nammfoodle> ironskin, regen, the pixie-dust healing potion, thorns potion
12:34 < nammfoodle> when I fought the original easymode wurm, I set myself up just out of its reach and shot arrows down at it whenever it tried to jump up at me
12:34 < nammfoodle> the lasers keep me from using that tric here
12:35 < Svitkona> have you tried building an arena out of platforms
12:35 < nammfoodle> yep.
12:35 < nammfoodle> lemme quick put together an altimeter so I can tell you how high the platforms are
12:36 < Svitkona> that's ok
12:36 < Svitkona> hmm
12:36 < Svitkona> idk
12:37 < Svitkona> if you really just want the components, you could use the meteorite trick
12:37 < Svitkona> like, build a layer of meteorite and stand on it
12:37 < Svitkona> you get a period of invincibility after you get hurt
12:37 < nammfoodle> I don't want to cheat, I just want to complete the game
12:38 < Svitkona> well, try getting adamantite armour
12:38 < nammfoodle> and if that doesn't work what's the next step?
12:39 < Svitkona> you might want someone to help you kill it
12:39 < nammfoodle> multiplayer? I thought this was supposed to be singleplayer.
12:39 < nammfoodle> ugh
12:40 < Svitkona> it's really helpful
12:41 < nammfoodle> I was using terraria as my mindless hobby to do while listening to audiobooks, not a social event.
12:41 < Svitkona> hmm
12:42 < nammfoodle> how about wyverns? any tips on dealing with them?
12:42 < Svitkona> anti gravity potions help
12:42 < Svitkona> i've never really had trouble with those :/
12:43 < Svitkona> unless like 3 of them spawn
12:43 < nammfoodle> where do you stand? do you go into space and rest on the skybox?
12:43 < nammfoodle> maybe I should try that.
12:44 < Svitkona> i have a platform there actually
12:44 < nammfoodle> platform where?
12:45 < Svitkona> like, a layer of platforms
12:45 < Svitkona> at the top of the world
12:45 < Svitkona> well
12:46 < Svitkona> what i do for destroyer is, i start on my arena of wooden platforms
12:46 < Svitkona> then if i ever need any health i kill the probes
12:46 < Svitkona> they drop hearts all the time
12:46 < nammfoodle> probes? are you talking about the wurm now?
12:46 < Svitkona> yeah
12:46 < Svitkona> doesn't it spawn those eye things
12:46 < nammfoodle> you go all the way up to the top of the world?
12:46 < Svitkona> that shoot lasers at you
12:48 < nammfoodle> yep
12:48 < Svitkona> when you kill them they drop hearts
12:49 < nammfoodle> I lose a LOT more health than what hearts give me

17:25 < Liraxus> Hmm...
17:26 < Liraxus> Oh my.
17:26 < Liraxus> I'm researching 505's track record.
17:26 < Liraxus> Its uh
17:26 < Liraxus> Pretty bad
17:26 < Liraxus> Most of the games they made are sports tie-ins
17:26 < Liraxus> But they do have one original series
17:26 < Liraxus> that uh...was critically panned.
17:26 < Liraxus> Its called "Naugty Bear"
17:27 < Liraxus> And the only praise it got was for its creative AI
17:27 < Liraxus> And according to their website and Wikipedia, its getting a sequel soon.
17:28 < Liraxus> Oh wait
17:28 < Liraxus> These guys made Arma.
17:28 < Liraxus> I've been interested in that game for its DayZ mod.

23:14 < nammfoodle> ooh, yeah
23:14 < nammfoodle> where do I find mimics?
23:14 < Andrio> yeah, that's the problem. They're somewhat rare.
23:14 < Andrio> You can find them anywhere underground.
23:15 < nammfoodle> anywhere?
23:15 < Andrio> yeah.
23:15 < nammfoodle> ho boy
23:16 < nammfoodle> would battle potions help?
23:16 < Andrio> Probably
23:17 < nammfoodle> woah, water candles attract baddies too?
23:17 < Andrio> 'A great way to farm these for their multiple rarer drops, is to use a BattlePotion and Water Candle during Blood Moon in hardmode.' < from the Terraria Wiki
23:18 < nammfoodle> yeah
23:18 < nammfoodle> lemme try that.
23:18 < nammfoodle> is there a certain depth I have to go?
23:18 < Andrio> no
23:18 < Andrio> bbl

06:00 < MichaelGabrielR> hey guys
06:01 < Andrio> Hello
06:01 < MichaelGabrielR> Does anyone know what the new content will be?
06:01 < Andrio> New content?
06:01 < MichaelGabrielR> Andrio - Terraria is comming to xbox and psn
06:02 < MichaelGabrielR> I'm asking because Terraria 1.1 felt like a scam
06:02 < MichaelGabrielR> Making the world 100% hollow doesn't do anything
06:03 < MichaelGabrielR> The driad still tells you that the world still neads to be cleansed of corruption and that I need to try harder.
06:03 < Andrio> Yeah, she's not too accurate in my world either. -_-
06:04 < MichaelGabrielR> I was pretty dissapointed. With that and because the game has trouble extending its mechanics, resorting to variety through stats.
06:04 < MichaelGabrielR> Once I got all the best gear, the game was essentially over
06:05 < MichaelGabrielR> The only boss that was really challenging was the 1st Sceletron
06:06 < MichaelGabrielR> Though I'm still curious which direction will the game go with the new release...
06:07 < MichaelGabrielR> I did pour 65 hours into this game after all
06:08 < china> smalltime
06:08 < MichaelGabrielR> I just wish it was more skill-based instead putting so much emphasis on grinding
06:09 < china> have you ever tried any mods?
06:09 < china> i don't know any specific mods that would bump up the general difficulty
06:09 < MichaelGabrielR> I've seen reborn mod
06:09 < MichaelGabrielR> It's just new content
06:10 < china> pretty much
06:10 < china> i did read about one mod which seemed to be really difficult, or maybe it was a map that came with the mod or something
06:11 < MichaelGabrielR> I've counted how much does it take to master the games mechanics - few minutes. Not learn, mind you. The game's mechanics (or dynamics) should be easy to learn and hard to master.
06:12 < MichaelGabrielR> Terraria seems to exhoust its potential pretty early into the game, which is sad, seeing its potential.
06:12 < china> pretty much
06:12 < MichaelGabrielR> oops, sorry for the redundancy
06:12 < MichaelGabrielR> Which part of Terraria was your favourite?
06:13 < china> hardmode and on
06:14 < china> though i'm always a bit reluctant because i enjoy building and stuff too
06:14 < china> and hardmode always seemed to ruin that safety :D
06:14 < china> but in terms of bosses and progression i like hardmode
06:14 < MichaelGabrielR> china - yeah, the enemies became more annying than challenging. It was immaginary hard - they just took more hits.
06:15 < china> the fact that you're required to kill the bosses in order to advance in gear is nice i think
06:15 < china> mind you, i am not particularly against grinding either
06:15 < china> there are limits, but i think terraria is within those for me
06:18 < MichaelGabrielR> you're right with that. It just woulnd't feel right if gold was so easy to find. Then again, it went overboard with Holy water recipie (pixie dust)
06:18 < MichaelGabrielR> Even on a small world, it took forever to use. Adamentium drill did the job however
06:19 < MichaelGabrielR> It still took forever though. Managed to drill few tunnels to underwold before giving up, oppening an editor and deleting everything except my base
06:20 < MichaelGabrielR> worst still - the chests, chairs and other things are counted to the corruption/hollow percentage
06:24 < MichaelGabrielR> Anyway, have a nice day

06:53 < iris253> think could be a prob that were gpoing online from the same connetion
06:53 -!- Jasmine-2 is now known as Jasmine
06:54 < Andrio> is it not working?
06:54 < iris253> no the port is open but when my freind want to join it takes about hours and nothings happen
06:55 -!- xPi_ghosted is now known as xPi
06:55 < iris253> imworking with the terraria server so that we both have just to join
06:55 < Andrio> You don't need to port forward if you're both on the same wireless LAN.
06:55 < iris253> but i dont now where the prob is
06:56 < iris253> thought it was the port
06:56 < iris253> but it still doesnt work
06:56 < Andrio> Are you starting a server on your computer?
06:56 < iris253> yes
06:56 < Andrio> Do you have your local IP address?
06:56 < iris253> imstarting wiht terraria server a server on my pc
06:56 < iris253> yes about whatsmyip.com
06:57 < iris253> and the friend wrote down the ip that was at 13.00 and it still is connenting ^^
06:57 < Andrio> No, if you're on the same LAN you don't need that
06:57 < Andrio> The IP address from ipconfig will work in that case
06:58 < Andrio> Also, if it hasn't connected in 55 minutes it's not going to connect >_>
06:58 < iris253> trying ip config
07:00 < iris253> its connecting
07:00 < Andrio> Can you open a command prompt window?
07:00 < Andrio> [21:56:10] <Andrio> Also, if it hasn't connected in 55 minutes it's not going to connect >_>
07:01 < Andrio> really, if it hasn't connected in 1 minute it's probably not going to connect.
07:01 < iris253> ok i just tried to connect with my ip about cmd ip config
07:02 < iris253> just trying to connect nothing else ^^
07:03 < Andrio> Can you open a command prompt?
07:04 < iris253> you mean the cmd command ???
07:04 < Andrio> yeah
07:04 < iris253> the window ?
07:04 < iris253> yes
07:04 < iris253> its open
07:04 < Andrio> type ipconfig
07:04 < iris253> just tiped ipconfig
07:04 < Andrio> and press enter
07:04 < iris253> yes
07:04 < iris253> already done
07:05 < Andrio> Do you see a field called 'IPv4 address'?
07:05 < Andrio> or just 'IP address'?
07:05 < iris253> there are a lot of numbers i not really now which one i have to juse
07:05 < iris253> jep
07:05 < Andrio> what's the IP address?
07:05 < iris253> 10.0.0.5
07:06 < iris253> thats the ipc4
07:06 < iris253> IPv4
07:06 < Andrio> ok
07:06 < Andrio> Your server is running, right?
07:07 < iris253> tried this adress nothing happened
07:07 < iris253> server is running
07:07 < Andrio> on port 7777?
07:07 < iris253> jep
07:08 < iris253> sry paaword 1234
07:09 < Andrio> Are you getting any messages about a firewall?
07:10 < iris253> aöready allowed terraria to communicate wiht the internet
07:10 < Andrio> The server and your client?
07:11 < iris253> what is server and wahts the client
07:11 < iris253> have to allow terraria server think i did it
07:11 < Andrio> You'll need to allow both the server and the client to communicate with the internet.
07:12 < Andrio> The client being the program that you use to join the server.
07:12 < iris253> what is the client in this case ?
07:12 < iris253> in this case terraria
07:12 < iris253> thought i had done this but im not sure
07:12 < iris253> where can i take a look  ? if i have done this
07:13 < Andrio> well, your firewall will have a list of exceptions somewhere.
07:13 < Andrio> It depends on what firewall software you have.
07:14 < iris253> do i have to look on my antivirus software or on windows firewall od on both
07:14 < iris253> ???
07:19 < Andrio> probably just the antivirus.
07:19 < iris253> the games can communicate above the firewall on both pcs and on my pc the terraria server too
07:20 < Andrio> Can you join the server from the same computer by entering 127.0.0.1 as the IP?
07:22 < iris253> fromthe server pc i can connect to the game wiht both ips
07:22 < iris253> from the other pc i cant connect with 10.0.0.5
07:22 < Andrio> ok
07:23 < Andrio> let's open a command prompt on the other pc
07:23 < Andrio> enter: ping 10.0.0.5
07:24 < ShadyDeath> is there a way i can use tedit with tconfig world?

07:25 < Andrio> ok
07:25 < iris253> think were near the prob ^^
07:25 < Andrio> You say you're both on wireless LAN?
07:25 < iris253> the other pc wont find my pc
07:25 < iris253> yes
07:25 < Andrio> yeah.
07:25 < Andrio> Are you connected to the same hotspot?
07:26 < iris253> yes
07:27 < iris253> ??? is this a problem ??
07:27  * Andrio notices Spitfire has ops again.
07:27 < Andrio> If your computers can't see each other... yeah.
07:28 < iris253> do you now  what i can do that they can see each other ?
07:28 < Andrio> I wouldn't say that networking is my strong point though.
07:28 < iris253> ^^
07:28 < iris253> mimne either
07:29  * Andrio notices misuse of the word 'ping' in the topic. >_>
07:30 < iris253> spo its a prob in the naetwork not in the game or in the thinks i made to run terraria
07:30 < Andrio> If your computers can't see each other, it's probably the network.
07:30 < iris253> i just have tomake them to see each other
07:31 < iris253> ok im going to read something about it its better to now where the prob is then just to know that there is one ^^

07:36 < ShadyDeath> lameruzer: if you mean by tiy. its starbound

08:06 < Andrio> without*
08:07 < ShadyDeath> i did that to quite some time ago but the way i did it doesnt work anymore
08:08 < Andrio> What was the way you did it?
08:09 < ShadyDeath> well i made a hole i wanted the lava in, then i made on the top a 1 block corner and dappidly clicked with the bucket there to make lava fall in and keep my bucket filled
08:10 < ShadyDeath> rappidly*

08:10 < ShadyDeath> worked for me back then
08:10 < Andrio> With water it does, but with lava you have to wait until it's spilled a little bit off the block and then click.
08:11 < Andrio> about 400 milliseconds.
08:12 < ShadyDeath> well i am now making one like this: http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110613193058/terraria/images/thumb/7/7d/Obsidian_Generator_Upper_Part.png/400px-Obsidian_Generator_Upper_Part.png . should that be fine?
08:14 < ShadyDeath> i would use pumps but cant get them yet
08:14 < Andrew> Pretty sure that the blocks in the centre are pointless.
08:16 < Andrew> Also, if you extend that 1 block platform for the lava to maybe 4 or 5 blocks then after the lava has covered a few blocks of the platform you should be able to rapidly click like you can for water.
08:20 < Andrio> Andrew, if you mean that triangle formation, I think they're not pointless.
08:21 < Andrew> It takes more time to place them than it's worth either way at least, heh.

09:03 < iris322> ?
09:03 < DarkAceZ> jes
09:04 < DarkAceZ> but that's piracy
09:04 < Andrew> Not legally.
09:04 < iris322> hahaah omg i played this game 4 moths ago and it was free
09:05 < DarkAceZ> no
09:05 < DarkAceZ> never was
09:07 < iris322> wtf man i played terraira on servers, used ip from terrairaonline, i played before this 1.1.2
09:07 < iris322> for free
09:08 < DarkAceZ> lol
09:10 < iris322> when you start playing terraira
09:11 < DarkAceZ> dunno
09:12 < Andrio> I remember the time when the corruption had the same music as the dungeon.
09:12 < Andrew> I started a little over a year ago I think.
09:13 < ShadyDeath> i started playing somewhere before the summer of 2011 if i am correct
09:13 < iris322> andrew and you say that terraira was never free ?
09:14 < Andrio> And you could hold torches underwater.
09:14 < Andrew> I didn't say that, but as far as I know it was never free. It hasn't been free in the bit over a year that I've been playing it at least.
09:14 < ShadyDeath> :< i cant click fast enough to make my water dupe. 2x with a bucket and then i dont make it anymore whith clicking
09:14 < Andrio> And they would work.
09:14 < Andrew> Macro it, ShadyDeath? lol
09:14  * Andrio can still use torches underwater.
09:14 < iris322> i just know that i was able to download terraira everywere for free 4 months ago
09:15 < iris322> now i cant find terraira for free anywhere
09:15 < ShadyDeath> andrew: i have a auto clicker installed but it doesnt work with terraria somehow
09:15 < Andrew> Any free copies are illegal pirated copies.
09:15 < iris322> they take money for dead game damn
09:15 < DarkAceZ> iris322, he's still getting money
09:15 < iris322> man i downloaded 1.1.0 1.1.1 from

09:26 < Andrew> Dropping the water in the right place?
09:26 < ShadyDeath> i assume... where exactly? i have the water duper as in the pic
09:27 < ShadyDeath> you know the pyramid based duper
09:27 < Andrew> Drop it on the one block that sticks up.
09:27 < ShadyDeath> so the top of the pyramid thing
09:29 < Andrew> http://i.imgur.com/lWdqJ.png
09:29 < Andrew> Lol, Andrio there's going to be another "CryptoParty" at the end of the month.
09:31 < Andrio> ?
09:32 < Andrew> Saw some thing about it in the age the other day. Was a little thing teaching people about online privacy or something. And TOR.

09:34 < Andrew> I'd almost be tempted to go for the "lulz" if I didn't already have something on.
09:35 < ShadyDeath> andrew: well my water tank doesnt fill... maybe too big pyramid?
09:35 -!- Valtteri is now known as Saku|SuperMarioFlash
09:35 < Andrew> Dunno. I guess if the pyramid works then it might take a long time to notice the effects.
09:36 < Andrew> But since it's water you wouldn't need the effects of the pyramid anyway.
09:36 < ShadyDeath> sending you the image on irc

09:42 < Andrew> Try extending the "mini tank" under where you drop the water by 1 block.
09:44 < ShadyDeath> yea the pyramid is too big. it doesnt even spread anymore after a few layers
09:47 < ShadyDeath> fills damn fast now

11:20 < Da_Wrecka> ShadyDeath: If my Hori controller is set as the primary controller, it still gets sidelined in pre-XInput games.
11:20 < ShadyDeath> lol >.>
11:21 < Da_Wrecka> Example; I have a Saitek Pro Gamer Command Unit and the Hori controller connected. the Hori is set as primary in the Joysticks control panel. PSO uses the Saitek regardless.
11:21 < Da_Wrecka> I can unplug both, then plug in the Hori followed by the Saitek; no difference.
11:21 < Da_Wrecka> Only if I unplug the Saitek entirely can I get the fucker to use the Hori controller.
11:22 < Da_Wrecka> Meanwhile, the same game running on my Windows XP machine with the Hori and a generic Saturn/Dreamcast/PSx converter connected together STILL uses the Hori as the primary controller
11:22 < Da_Wrecka> Conclusion; Windows XP is fine, Windows 7 is dumb as shit.
11:22 < ShadyDeath> hmm yea on that base its indeed dumb
11:23 < Da_Wrecka> Oh, yes. Windows 7 with the Saturn/PSx/DC converter connected with the Hori; same results as with the Saitek. The Hori gets ignored in favour of the other one.

16:45 < Liraxus> The game is slow as fuck
16:45 < Liraxus> on consoles
16:51 < Liraxus> And really, i think the new content could have been shown off more
16:51 < Liraxus> Than just giving us a peak at a new kind of shark.
16:52 < Liraxus> And yes i know Orca's technically aren't sharks but they probably share the same AI

17:06 <+Nightmare> DarkAceZ: I've had it for a long time, got it back in February
17:07 <+Nightmare> iirc it was just as a joke back then
17:10 < Liraxus> Think i finally found a good idea for my first 3 minerals
17:10 < Liraxus> Azuldos, rojotres, and azuluno
17:13 < Liraxus> Wait
17:13 < Liraxus> No
17:13 < Liraxus> Wrong way
17:13 < Liraxus> Azuldos, verdetres, and rojouno
17:14 < Liraxus> Rojouno is the weakest yet increases the users movement speed and melee speed by 10
17:14 < Liraxus> Azuldos is the second, focused on ranged weaponry, it makes bow shots faster and more accurate and increases ranged damage.
17:16 < Liraxus> And finally, Verdetres, the rarest of the 3, it offers a focus on overall maneuverability, increasing walk speed by 12, jump hight by 5 blocks, and makes all melee weapons act like the muramasa or excalibur.
17:19 < Liraxus> Combining the 3 ores form's diosoro, which can be crafted into its own armor set, but whats unique is that it can create 2 different kinds of armors that are extremely powerful in their own ways.
17:20 < Liraxus> Diosoro Alcane is meant to be a powerful ranged armor, it increases your rate of fire, ranged damage, arrow accuracy, and a 50% chance not to waste bullets.
17:21 < Liraxus> Or 25% chance if that is too OP with the megashark
17:22 < Liraxus> Diosoro ponche allows for extreme maneuverability like Azuldos while increasing the rate of attack for melee weapons, having them work like muramasa, and their overall damage.

17:49 < nammfoodle> I'm trying to beat the hardcore wurm boss and I'm setting up my arena right now
17:49 < nammfoodle> does lava hurt him?
17:50 < nammfoodle> if I put pools of lava underneath the platform I fight on will it hurt him?
17:50 < Nightmare> idk my bff jill
17:52 < nammfoodle> I've got all my adamantite armor
17:52 < nammfoodle> fully upgraded repeater
17:52 < nammfoodle> fully upgraded phasesaber
17:53 < nammfoodle> eight different types of potions
17:53 < nammfoodle> angel's wings
17:53 < Suwako> Get Hallowed
17:53 < Suwako> And no, it doesn't hurt it
17:53 < nammfoodle> Suwako, I thought I had to beat the bosses to get hallowed. can get I get hallowed armor before then?
17:53 < Suwako> Oh right
17:53 < Suwako> The souls
17:53 < Suwako> Forgot
17:53 < Suwako> My bad
17:54 < Suwako> But yes, laval does not hurt it
17:54 < nammfoodle> ok, thanks for saving me some time
17:54 < Suwako> If it's the destroyer you're talking about
17:54 < nammfoodle> maybe there's an accessory I could drop? I'm using Angel's Wings, cobalt shield, cross necklace, philosopher's stone, and spectre boots
17:54 < Suwako> I don't remember if the others are hurt by it though ...
17:55 < Suwako> This boss is damn easy if you have a weapon that hits multiple times in one area like the flamethrower
17:56 < nammfoodle> I tried using the highest-level version of the ball o' hurt
17:56 < nammfoodle> getting that close was too much risk though
17:56 < nammfoodle> that's why I'm using the repeater. I can keep a good distance and still get damage in
17:57 < nammfoodle> how big of a range does the flamethrower have?
17:57 < Suwako> The YinYang orb thing is very long ranged, fyi
17:57 < Suwako> Eeeh - decently long
17:57 < Suwako> I can't come up with something to compare it with right now ...
17:59 < nammfoodle> flamethrower needs me to beat Skeletron Prime first
18:00 < nammfoodle> Dao of Pow is the item you're looking for
18:00 < nammfoodle> this I might be able to work with

07:15 < Chosenlama> everything is gone
07:16 < Andrio> that's not good.

07:17 < Chosenlama> well, as i said there is nothing in the players folder idk where it could be else
07:18 < Andrio> well, if your saves were deleted you can't really get them back, unless you have another copy somewhere.

15:44 < Jetthebuizel> I just saw the link to the IRC channel.
15:44 < Jetthebuizel> I decided to finally check it out.
15:44 <@Spitfire> Heh.
15:44 <@Spitfire> Well, it's mostly dead these days.
15:44 < Jetthebuizel> I see that.
15:44 < Jetthebuizel> I am guessing you are moderator, am I correct?
15:45 < china> I am guessing you haven't used IRC much, am I correct?
15:45 <@Spitfire> Yep. I'm an operator in this channel.
15:45 < Jetthebuizel> Nice. China no need to make fun of others.
15:45 < Jetthebuizel> Yes I haven't used this IRC before give me a break and back off.
15:46 <@TrinityFlash> Play nicely you two. :<
15:46 < china> I was merely asking a question, what's with the hosti- okay i'll stop
15:46 < Jetthebuizel> Gah, Are there many modders that come on here. I make minecraft mods but I wanted to get into modding Terraria.
15:46 <@Spitfire> Jetthebuizel, hmm.
15:46 < Jetthebuizel> Sorry china.
15:46 <@Spitfire> The tshock people used to come on here.
15:47 <@Spitfire> But I'm not sure any of them still do...

15:54 < Nightmare> Spitfire: It's supposed to be three lines the same
15:54 < Nightmare> That guy did like five
15:54 <@Spitfire> Nah, it's more than 3
15:54 <@Spitfire> It's either 4 or 5.
15:55 <@Spitfire> (it got upped. I think it might have been 3 before.)
15:55 < Nightmare> It should be 3 lines the same
15:55 <@Spitfire> Nah, that's too few.
15:55 < Nightmare> It seems just right to me
15:55 <@Spitfire> It got false positives when it was 3.
15:55 <@Spitfire> It hasn't had a single false positive on it's current settings.
15:55 < Nightmare> When are you ever going to send three lines that are the exact same
15:55 <@Spitfire> "lol"
15:56 <@Spitfire> Or "hi"
15:56 < Nightmare> That does not sound like a false positive to me

11:29 <@Marketh> why's that?
11:29 < nekronuke> said starbound is going to kill it, no point in continueing
11:29 < nekronuke> head programmer gave me the rights to the code, however.
11:29 <@Marketh> interesting
11:29 < nekronuke> boss wasn't pleased, but can't fire me yet
11:29 <@Marketh> you shouldn't stop just because of Starbound though that's silly
11:30 < nekronuke> too late, oh well
11:30 <@Marketh> Their loss

18:15 <@Marketh> as far as I can see you're both being pretty childish
18:15 <@Marketh> if you want to go at eachother make a channel for it
18:15 <@Marketh> so you can ban eachother all day long

18:16 <@TrinityFlash> You still made a point to try to take me down and bitch about it
18:16 <@Nightmare> And I don't do it almost every day.
18:16 <@Marketh> jesus you two
18:16 <@Marketh> can you at least keep the arguments private too
18:16 <@Nightmare> Marketh: go back to your game or whatever this is too much fun
18:17 <@Marketh> i think it's stupid
18:17 <@Nightmare> It is stupid. ;p
18:17 <@Marketh> then don't do it?
18:17 <@Ignoritus> I totally understand why Nightmare and Spitfire get along so well.
18:17 <@TrinityFlash> Nightmare: The only reason you have any power is because of Spitfire. In reality you're a much worse operator than me that didn't earn anything.
18:17 <@Marketh> you are meant to be better than the people who would hang out in smbx and/or knuxcentral
18:17 <@Marketh> but here you are all acting no better than them
18:17 <@Nightmare> TrinityFlash: Not true. ;p
18:17 <@TrinityFlash> Uh, true.
18:17 <@Nightmare> Nope.
18:17 <@Ignoritus> While I think his way of putting it is quite immature.
18:18 <@Ignoritus> I will agree with TF on his better operator point..
18:18 <@Nightmare> lol
18:18 <@Nightmare> You two go back to fapping over ponies, mmkay?
18:18 <@TrinityFlash> I worked hard to get where I am; being a tester of Terraria, an operator of this channel, and back a long time ago, a tester of SMBX.
18:18 <@Ignoritus> The maturity rings.
18:18 <@TrinityFlash> You dated Spitfire.
18:18 <@TrinityFlash> Congrats.
18:18 <@Ignoritus> This is exactly why I think TF is a better operator nightmare.
18:18 <@Nightmare> lulwot
18:18 <@Ignoritus> He doesn't lose an argument and make a comment about jacking off to ponies.
18:19 <@Nightmare> I haven't lost an argument.
18:19 <@Nightmare> I just think he's a dumb bitch and I can't be bothered to argue with an idiot.
18:19 <@Ignoritus> Which was childish to TF, but downright ignorant to me considering I don't even watch MLP.
18:19 <@Ignoritus> I must agree with Marketh in the end though.
18:19 <@Ignoritus> We all need to shut the fuck up or take it elsewhere.
18:20 <@Nightmare> Should just shut the fuck up tbh, I've already achieved making TrinityFlash mad anyway ;p
18:20 <@TrinityFlash> So that was your goal, eh?
18:21 <@Nightmare> Yes, because I was bored. And no it doesn't prove jack shit about how I am as an OP or w/e so you can be quiet there too

18:22 < TrinityFlash> She just laughs in my face.
