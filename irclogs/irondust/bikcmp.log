16:41 -!- Irssi: Starting query in irondust with bikcmp
16:41 <bikcmp> so
16:41 <bikcmp> i'm very pissed off at the current staff of id
16:41 <bikcmp> id = irondust
16:41 <bikcmp> one in particular
16:42 <bikcmp> spitfire is dating nightmare
16:42 <bikcmp> yeah, irc dating, bleh. 
16:42 <bikcmp> but, nightmare is fucking obsessed with "ddos" and making jokes in regards to attacks
16:42 <`> lolwat
16:42 <bikcmp> and flooding.
16:42 <`> >female on IRC
16:42 <`> >NEVER HAPPEN
16:42 <bikcmp> yeah
16:42 <`> just kidding, but go on
16:42 <bikcmp> besides the point
16:42 <bikcmp> lol
16:42 <bikcmp> so, about 2 weeks ago
16:42 <bikcmp> nightmare flooded #social and 3 other chans as spitfire watched and did nothing
16:43 <bikcmp> i warned spitfire about it, he was like "mmm, okay"
16:43 <bikcmp> nightmare later said she was sorry
16:43 <`> heh, just never make me do omegaspam.
16:43  * ` lides
16:43 <bikcmp> and then told me about how spitfire spies on her conversations
16:43 <bikcmp> i confirmed that, spitfire actually installed rootkits on the servers
16:43 <bikcmp> he installed it, nightmare found it
16:44 <bikcmp> he removed it, then he put it back on
16:44 <bikcmp> i knew about that
16:44 <bikcmp> and i was extremely po'ed.
16:44 <bikcmp> i didn't mentiona nything about it yet
16:44 <bikcmp> but, today, nightmare flooded the shit out of a channel her
16:44 <`> well, that would be grounds for termination of staff status
16:44 <bikcmp> e
16:44 <bikcmp> and my backlog.
16:44 <bikcmp> my away log is /FULL/ of bullshit.
16:44 <bikcmp> FULL of it.
16:44 <`> i DO NOT tolerate rootkits of any of that sort on my servers
16:45 <bikcmp> 12:36:14 #smbx: < CockLover> no point of giving the appearance of a well as a thesis job which to perform a thought occurred  to rape questionmark sakke deadfish erikmouse langkid1 wildclaw888 bikcmp erikmouse chanserv

16:45 <bikcmp> it's full of that
16:45 <`> as such, it'd be grounds for immediate expulsion
16:45 <bikcmp> 10000 lines long.
16:45 <bikcmp> 1 hours of 10 messages a second
16:45 <`> yeah.
16:45 <bikcmp> probably more
16:45 <bikcmp> so
16:45 <`> remove those two.
16:45 <bikcmp> no, the thing is
16:45 <bikcmp> the server in which these attacks were comng from
16:45 <bikcmp> in fact, the two servers
16:45 <bikcmp> they were donated to irondust.
16:45 <bikcmp> i don't own them, i had a fight with the owner
16:45 <bikcmp> and he gave them to spitfire for IRONDUST USAGE ONLY
16:46 <bikcmp> and the bouncer. and testnet.
16:46 <bikcmp> the attack before came from these ips too
16:46 <`> well, i'd delink
16:46 <bikcmp> it isn't a link
16:46 <bikcmp> irondust doesn't link
16:46 <bikcmp> but, today i notified the server sponsor
16:46 <bikcmp> and he's like, "AGAIN?"
16:46 <bikcmp> "i'll talk to him, i just suspended the vpses"
16:46 <`> this is exactly why i dont kinda like your ircd setup
16:46 <`> no way to protect the network from rogue serves
16:47 <bikcmp> well
16:47 <bikcmp> i'm going to change that
16:47 <bikcmp> very soon.
16:47 <`> i can remove "power" from such servers
16:47 <bikcmp> i can too.
16:47 <`> but still allow links
16:47 <`> as in
16:47 <bikcmp> i trusted spitfire
16:47 <`> if an ircop there did a /kill - wouldnt work
16:47 <`> qlines, i think it was
16:47 <bikcmp> yeah
16:47 <bikcmp> but it's largely inefficent
16:47  * bikcmp shrugs
16:47 <bikcmp> i don't care for those types of ircds.
16:47 <bikcmp> i dunno.
16:47 <bikcmp> but, here
16:47 <bikcmp> i need an opinion
16:47 <bikcmp> not ircd war
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Dan> first of all, FR should have been done turned off
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Dan> second of all, our TOS forbids flooding
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Dan> so let's talk about how you are gonna resolve this
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Spitfire> First, lets just be clear on something.
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Spitfire> You never.
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Spitfire> Ever.
16:47 <bikcmp> 19:58:50  <Dan> <Spitfire> Do that again.
16:48 <bikcmp> don't share these logs or talk to these people
16:48 <`> i won't.
16:48 <bikcmp> 20:13:12  <Dan> <Dan> what steps do you plan to take to prevent this problem in the future?
16:48 <bikcmp> 20:13:12  <Dan> <Spitfire> In actuality, I haven't violated your ToS.
16:48 <bikcmp> 20:14:39  <Dan> Dan> ok, let's go through this real fast
16:48 <bikcmp> 20:14:39  <Dan> <Dan> I see a large ammount or irc traffic outgoing, somebody posts about a flood in smbx, and then bikcmp posts the ip in smbx
16:49 <bikcmp> so yeah
16:49 <bikcmp> o
16:49 <bikcmp> i then confront him
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:04:47  <bikcmp> did you know nightmare was doing that?
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:04:50  <bikcmp> ...
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:07  <Spitfire> What of it?
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:18  <bikcmp> the spam in #smbx?
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:22  <bikcmp> i just did /away
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:23  <bikcmp> and like
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:29  <bikcmp> my buffer was full of 100000's of lines
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:32  <bikcmp> of junk.
16:49 <bikcmp> 20:12:37  <Spitfire> mkay
16:49 <bikcmp> "mkay"
16:50 <bikcmp> so, his box currently runs nameservers for irondust, and silver.irondust.net
16:50 <bikcmp> i pulled silver from our dns
16:50 <bikcmp> i plan on killing it tonight
16:50 <bikcmp> along with almost all of our staff team.
16:51 <`> it has to be done, if they continue to defy you
16:51 <bikcmp> yes
16:51 <bikcmp> so
16:51 <`> pulling them sends the signal that you wont tolerate their crap.
16:51 <bikcmp> i'm looking for 3 or 4 people to replace the current staff.
16:51 <bikcmp> interested?
16:51 <bikcmp> sue, too, if he's around
16:52 <bikcmp> i'm adding dan, the sponsor who i've known for a long time
16:52 <`> what would the duties entail, exactly?
16:52 <bikcmp> well
16:52 <`> dan who? if i may ask
16:52 <bikcmp> dan petter something
16:52 <`> aha
16:53 <`> okay, so the duties?
16:53 <`> just so you know, i'm very hands off
16:53 <bikcmp> hands off?
16:53 <`> i only intervene if someone's being a huge troll/asshole
16:53 <`> otherwise, i just maintain things behind the scenes
16:53 <bikcmp> yeah
16:53 <bikcmp> well
16:53 <`> i dont even like +o or any of that in channels
16:53 <bikcmp> i'd want you to monitor #help
16:53 <bikcmp> and like
16:53 <`> yeah, that'd be easy enough
16:53 <bikcmp> you know
16:53 <bikcmp> take care of stuff.
16:53 <`> yeah
16:54 <bikcmp> make sure if shit breaks, it's fixed.
16:54 <`> yep :P
16:54 <bikcmp> i think i'm going to make 'teams' this time around.
16:54 <`> or any troublemakers bounced out
16:54 <`> :P
16:54 <bikcmp> i don't want irondust to be just irc.
16:54 <`> :P
16:54 <bikcmp> so. yeah.
16:54 <bikcmp> i'm going to make 'teams'.
16:54 <bikcmp> you'd be part of the 'irc' team
16:55 <bikcmp> making sure irc is taken care of, and our irc service is working.
16:55 <bikcmp> i'm about to move on to the next stuff.
16:55 <bikcmp> i'm still debating on what to do next though-
16:55 <bikcmp> i'm kinda liking that cyberlocker / dropbox idea.
16:55 <bikcmp> lol
16:55 <`> haha yeah
16:55 <`> it's just too useful.
16:56 <bikcmp> that'd be a handy communication oriented tool.
16:56 <bikcmp> get what i mean?
16:56 <`> exactly.
16:56 <bikcmp> irondust is about making communication in groups easier.
16:56 <bikcmp> that's what the mission is.
16:56 <bikcmp> i started it off with IRC.
16:56 <`> i use mine for conveying ideas/pictures/whatnot
16:56 <bikcmp> now i want to do the next service, web-based.
16:56 <bikcmp> yeah
16:56 <bikcmp> i think i want to be the head of the locker project.
16:56 <`> :P
16:56 <bikcmp> like, there would be 'teams' like i said, though
16:56 <`> you're the developer.
16:56 <bikcmp> well
16:57 <bikcmp> i'm both@!
16:57 <bikcmp> !, rather
16:57 <bikcmp> basically, i'd like to be the person who manages irondust overall, but then we have sub-teams which manage a specific service
16:57 <bikcmp> for the locker, i'd probably add in 2 or 3 others as well, for coding.
16:58 <`> yeah.
16:58 <`> that makes more sense.
16:59 <`> or be like Valve
16:59 <`> do you know how their devs work?
16:59 <`> apparently they let their devs do whatever they want
16:59 <bikcmp> like google?
16:59 <`> not really
17:00 <`> Valve doesn't assign devs to any project.
17:00 <`> they literally allow the dev to decide.
17:00 <`> Valve says this "helps" innovation
17:00 <bikcmp> eh
17:00 <bikcmp> i'm not sure if i'd trust the staff team to do that.
17:00 <bikcmp> tbh.
17:01 <`> granted.
17:01 <bikcmp> i tried that this time around
17:01 <bikcmp> and like
17:01 <bikcmp> they just sit on their bums doing nothing
17:01 <`> yeah.
17:01 <`> it just depends on the people themselves, really.
17:01 <bikcmp> and refusing any change i want to make.
17:01 <`> Valve chooses amazing people.
17:01  * ` shrugs
17:01 <`> yeah, that's not contributing, that's blockign.
17:01 <`> *ing
17:01 <`> and/or not helping
17:02 <`> bascially they're here to help out ID
17:02 <`> and if they're not, they're not being 'staff'
17:02 <`> know what i mean?
17:02 <bikcmp> well
17:02 <bikcmp> yeah
17:02 <bikcmp> that's why i want to kill everyone on staff.
17:02 <`> heh
17:02 <bikcmp> i think i want to keep jstoker.
17:02 <bikcmp> he's a cool guy, and he's FUCKING SMART.
17:03 <`> i honestly dont know about the structure of id
17:03 <bikcmp> yeah
17:03 <bikcmp> but, he has no time.
17:03 <`> the only thing i really know about it is #hh :P
17:03 <`> and that you're the owner.
17:04 <bikcmp> yeah.
17:04 <bikcmp> but, you're the kind of person who would be good at this.
17:09 <`> sorry, was trying to clean the a/c
17:09 <bikcmp> np
17:09 <bikcmp> oh
17:09 <bikcmp> i also had a fingerspelling question.
17:09 <bikcmp> what's the difference between 'a' and 's'
17:09 <`> with 'a' the thumb is on the side
17:10 <`> and then the S has the thumb in front of the fist
17:10 <bikcmp> on the side?
17:10 <bikcmp> err
17:10 <bikcmp> sorry
17:10 <bikcmp> not a
17:10 <bikcmp> 'e' and 's'
17:10 <bikcmp> my bad
17:10 <`> e is kinda a "blown up" S
17:10 <bikcmp> blown up?
17:10 <`> when it's like the gay dragonballz kamehameha
17:10 <bikcmp> know where you could find a decent picture of the differences?
17:11 <bikcmp> the sites i look at, uh
17:11 <`> hold on
17:11 <bikcmp> they look /exactly the same/
17:11 <`> S is more of a full fist
17:11 <`> here.
17:11 <`> finding.
17:12 <`> fuck it
17:12 <`> i'm taking a pic
17:12 <`> this is "E": http://dgd.io/SHUC
17:13 <`> and then this is "S": http://dgd.io/eza1
17:13 <`> see what i mean?
17:13 <bikcmp> ah
17:13 <`> it's like an "exploded S"
17:13 <bikcmp> NOW i do, let me show you the sites i looked at
17:14 <bikcmp> http://asl.gs/slideshow/e.gif
17:14 <bikcmp> http://asl.gs/slideshow/s.gif
17:14 <bikcmp> see what i mean?
17:14 <`> i know
17:14 <`> that's the "standard" E
17:15 <`> which most deafies dont like
17:15 <`> but the rule of thumb is
17:15 <`> if the thumb is below the fingertips = E
17:15 <`> if it's over the fingers = S
17:15 <`> know what i mean?
17:15 <bikcmp> yeah
17:15 <bikcmp> that's what i did.
17:15 <`> nod.
17:16 <bikcmp> but, like
17:16 <bikcmp> to me, it looked very very similar.
17:17 <`> yeah, but there's differences
17:17 <`> :P
17:17 <bikcmp> :-P
17:17 <`> i wish i had a thermostat
17:17 <`> that showed temps
17:17 <`> AH!
17:17 <bikcmp> buy one, you cheap ass
17:18 <`> my fucking i7
17:18 <bikcmp> lol
17:18 <`> it's still running, so i can exec sensors
17:18 <`> it should have an ambient for me
17:18 <bikcmp> actually
17:18 <bikcmp> no
17:18 <bikcmp> it won't
17:18 <`> yes it does
17:18 <`> :D
17:18 <bikcmp> i'm sure the i7 has liquid cooling
17:18 <bikcmp> doesn't it?
17:18 <`> nope
17:18 <`> thats what's scary
17:18 <`> i'm using a giant heatsink with two fans
17:19 <bikcmp> hah
17:19 <`> (not kidding. the damn thing has 2 fans attached to the heatsink)
17:19 <bikcmp> did i tell you about my job?
17:19 <bikcmp> well
17:19 <bikcmp> like
17:19 <bikcmp> i'm bored as fuck over the summer
17:19 <bikcmp> right?
17:19 <`> okay
17:19 <`> my cores are 48C
17:19 <bikcmp> lol
17:19 <`> Core 0:       +47.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
17:19 <`> Core 1:       +48.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
17:19 <`> Core 2:       +48.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
17:19 <`> Core 3:       +44.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
17:20 <`> and then temp2 is the ambient temp sensor
17:20 <`> temp2:        +80.0°C  (high = +255.0°C, hyst = +251.0°C) (crit = +255.0°C, hyst = +251.0°C)  sensor = transistor
17:20 <`> 176F
17:20 <`> scary.
17:21 <`> that sensor's near the CPU so it's 'artifically' high
17:21 <`> still, though
17:21 <`> i probably should shut it down
17:21 <`> should I?
17:22 <bikcmp> lol
17:22 <bikcmp> sure
17:22 <bikcmp> but dude
17:22 <bikcmp> i found this guy who needed help managing his emails and shit online
17:22 <bikcmp> and wanted to pay at oregon min wage ($9/hr)
17:22 <bikcmp> dude
17:22 <bikcmp> $9 an hour doing very little with no expenses = :)
17:22 <bikcmp> so i set up his support email addy
17:23 <bikcmp> the next day he got an email from a client
17:23 <bikcmp> who wanted a linux server managed
17:23 <bikcmp> the guy i worked for didn't know how to do linux, so he was about to send back that he can't do it
17:23 <bikcmp> i said i did
17:23 <bikcmp> and so i talked to the guy
17:23 <bikcmp> and i configured the server very basicly
17:23 <bikcmp> took about 6 hours
17:23 <bikcmp> then he's like
17:23 <bikcmp> "know what, do you need a job?"
17:24 <bikcmp> so like
17:24 <bikcmp> if this dude is for real, that's awesome.
17:24 <`> that is, yeah.
17:24 <bikcmp> so
17:25 <bikcmp> while i was doing the job for him
17:25 <bikcmp> i kept saying my netbook sucks
17:25 <bikcmp> so he's like
17:25 <bikcmp> "i'll even give you a laptop as a welcome gift, if you need one to develop on"
17:25 <`> gg, lol
17:25 <bikcmp> gg?
17:25 <bikcmp> well
17:25 <`> i had a situation like that.
17:25 <bikcmp> if this dude's for real, we're set
17:25 <`> good god.
17:25 <bikcmp> but... yeah
17:25 <bikcmp> there's of course a good chance it isn't real
17:26 <`> i once had a boss like that
17:26 <bikcmp> yeah
17:26 <bikcmp> he seems like he's legit, though.
17:26 <bikcmp> i guess we'll know soon
17:26 <`> my old boss
17:26 <`> he literally spent $5500 on me
17:26 <bikcmp> !
17:26 <`> in one go
17:26 <bikcmp> he was also insisting that i get paid
17:26 <`> a PowerBook G4 1.67GHz
17:26 <`> i agreed to accept that as wages for the first year.
17:26 <`> completely maxed out.
17:26 <`> the last G4 made.
17:27 <`> i was a monster with that thing
17:27 <`> did projects very quickly :P
17:27 <`> then eventually it showed its age (PPC)
17:28 <bikcmp> yeah.
17:28 <bikcmp> i'm on this shitty netbook
17:28 <bikcmp> so
17:28 <bikcmp> lol
17:28 <`> then i managed to sell off my PC parts (friend works at a dump that has its own thrift store attached, so he rescues electronics for me)
17:28 <`> and raised enough for two things.
17:30 <bikcmp> wow
17:30 <bikcmp> nice man
17:31 <bikcmp> i /really/ need a better laptop
17:31 <bikcmp> 22:26:16  <`> a PowerBook G4 1.67GHz
17:31 <bikcmp> i'm running at 1 ghz.
17:31 <bikcmp> lol
17:31 <bikcmp> model name: Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU   @  1.00GHz
17:33 <bikcmp> so yeah
17:33 <bikcmp> well
17:33 <bikcmp> what i'm thinking is
17:33 <bikcmp> with my wage, maybe get a laptop
17:33 <bikcmp> and this guy wants to get me a chromebook
17:37 <`> heh yeah
17:37 <`> my specs for *this* machine is
17:38 <`> 2.26GHz Intel Core2Duo
17:38 <bikcmp> asshole
17:38 <bikcmp> :(
17:38 <`> 4GB 1027MHz DDR3
17:38 <bikcmp> ship it to me!
17:38 <`> lol noep
17:38 <`> my main machine.
17:38 <`> gotta love this laptop.
17:38 <bikcmp> i hate you
17:38 <bikcmp> god
17:39 <`> lols, er
17:39 <bikcmp> yeah
17:40 <`> jesus to the fuckity Christ
17:40 <`> google.com
17:40 <`> weather 92399
17:41 <`> no wonder im dying of heat
17:43 <`> and that's partly cloudy
17:43 <`> x.x
17:43 <`> the earth is going to hell in a handbasket.

20:11 <bikcmp> what do you need me to o

20:12 <`> idk nothing, just wondering what your plans are for it tonight
20:12 <bikcmp> to finish up the database i'm coding, then deploy it.
20:12 <bikcmp> :_P
20:12 <`> tonight?
20:12 <`> i want to put it into the rack tonight.
20:13 <`> if not tomorrow.
20:13 <bikcmp> what do you mean?
20:13 <bikcmp> put what in the rack?
20:13 <`> this system is in a 4u case
20:13 <`> which would fit into the 42U rack cabinet i have in my air-conditioned room
20:13 <bikcmp> put it in now while it isn't doing anything
20:13 <`> yep.
20:14 <`> sending sigterms now
20:14 <bikcmp> it'll need about 10 minutes to propgate the db
20:14 <bikcmp> and i don't want it interupted
20:14 <bikcmp> so yeah
20:14 <bikcmp> haha
20:14 <`> yeah, np
20:14 <bikcmp> note to self, 430
20:14 <`> ?
20:14 <`> for your code, i assume.
20:15 <bikcmp> yeah
20:15 <bikcmp> function(v) { var data = JSON.parse(v.values[0].data); if(data.lusername == \"%s\") { return [[v.key, data]]; } return []; }
20:15 <bikcmp> :-P
20:15 <`> :p
20:15 <`> what'd you think of the motd? ;p
20:16 <`> nice
20:16 <`> once it receives sigterm
20:16 <`> it says "Shutting down Xen domains:"
20:16 <`> so it shuts down everything gracefully.
20:17 <`> k, its down.
20:17 <`> moving it now.
20:17 <bikcmp> sure
20:17 <bikcmp> hf
20:19 <bikcmp> also
20:19 <bikcmp> please don't highlight/spam me.
20:19 <bikcmp> it makes it so it's extremely hard to see your message.
20:20 <bikcmp> i use a more strict version of xanoslib on my irssi client
20:20 <bikcmp> it autoignores you :)
20:20 <bikcmp> so then i need to unignore you then go into blocked/
20:23 <`> then permanently whitelist me
20:23 <`> ;)
20:23 <bikcmp> yeah, no
20:23 <bikcmp> it actually doesn't even support it ;p
20:24 <bikcmp> the way i wrote it would make it hard.

21:26 <`> it's all racked up
21:26 <bikcmp> nice
21:26 <bikcmp> what are your thoughts on the web stuff
21:26 <bikcmp> summery:
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:20:38  <@bikcmp> i have a question for you.
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:20:46  <@bikcmp> i'd like to shift irondust towards web based services
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:20:49  <@bikcmp> or other nonirc protocols.
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:21:37  <@bikcmp> so.
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:21:45  <@bikcmp> this requires an authentication gateway.
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:21:58  <@bikcmp> i don't want to rely on one server (services).  that adds a  /big/ point of failure. 
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:22:17  <@bikcmp> so, i'd like to make it so account management must be done  through a pretty nice web interface.
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:22:41  <@bikcmp> this might reduce what you can do with your irondust  account on irc (nickserv stuff), but it won't affect  chanserv/channels in any other way.
21:26 <bikcmp> 22:22:45  <@bikcmp> is this a good idea?

10:35 <`> 10:16 < `> Sue: it's bullshit that you're "upset" about it being used.
10:35 <`> 10:16 < `> Sue: and i did not downplay your anxiety. i just think you can overcome it.
10:35 <`> 10:17 < `> Sue: now dont fucking make me out as a bad guy.
10:35 <`> 10:17 < Sudos|PE2300> oh hai `

10:35 <`> 10:18 < Sudos|PE2300> are you sure your anxiety isn't panic attacks and you ddin't get it from a lyme-infested tick or  something
