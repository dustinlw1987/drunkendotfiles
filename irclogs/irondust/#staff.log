17:18 <@`> so
17:19 <@`> ucp needs to be fixed
17:19 <@`> readability is critical for users to understand it
17:19 <@bikcmp> like anyone reads it
17:19 <@bikcmp> lol
17:19 <@bikcmp> but yeah
17:19 <@bikcmp> you're absolutely free to help me with it
17:20 <@`> well, that's why
17:20 <@`> :P
17:20 <@`> even i barely can read it
17:20 <@`> its hard to follow
17:20 <@`> users would just give up
17:20 <@bikcmp> you're free to redesign the site completely
17:20 <@bikcmp> i think i want to work on the apis more than the site
17:20 <@bikcmp> lol
17:20 <@`> nah, i like the layout
17:20 <@`> it's simple, but powerful for a irc website
17:21 <@bikcmp> hm.
17:21 <@bikcmp> `: so
17:21 <@`> so gimme access
17:21 <@bikcmp> `: there's no way to really give you any access
17:21 <@bikcmp> the html is automatically made
17:21 <@bikcmp> it's, like
17:21 <@bikcmp> as alyx would say
17:21 <@bikcmp> fucko
17:21 <@bikcmp> no, it's bikcmp'd
17:21 <@`> uhm.
17:21  * ` slowly backs away.
17:21  * ` runs
17:21 <@bikcmp> yeah.
17:21 <@bikcmp> lol
17:22 <@bikcmp> `: it's literally /in/ python
17:22 <@bikcmp> pyjamas ;p
17:22 <@`> ouch
17:22 <@bikcmp> ouch?
17:22 <@bikcmp> fuck you
17:22 <@bikcmp> :P
17:22 <@`> overcomplicated for such a simple thing
17:22 <@`> that's the ouch.
17:22 <@bikcmp> it isn't tbh
17:22 <@bikcmp> `: well
17:22 <@bikcmp> here's the thing
17:22 <@bikcmp> i planned on doing more with the site than i did.
17:22 <@bikcmp> i ended up making accounts.id.net do that stuff.
17:22 <@bikcmp> lol
17:22 <@`> sigh
17:22 <@bikcmp> yeah.
17:23 <@bikcmp> `: so.  it's bootstrap.
17:23 <@`> yeah, twitter bootstrap.
17:24 <@`> good mother of god, those jolly ranchers chrunch'chew is fucking delicious
18:04 <@bikcmp> <3
18:39 <@`> not bad!
18:39 <@`> i pulvertized those gatorade energy chews
18:39 <@`> with ice and water in my blender
18:39 <@`> now it tastes sorta like cream orange (orange was the flavor i got)
18:40 <@`> instant energy smoothie
18:43 <@`> 100-calorie energy smoothie
18:43 <@`> how badass is that

18:06 <@`> }:A
18:09 <@`> i have a serve for wolfram
18:09 <@`> if you're still interested
18:16 <@Marketh> Dan, [00:03:16] <MasterBTB> bossedit8 had it coming
18:16 <@Marketh> sounds like the flooding was intentional even in pm
18:16 <@Marketh> should the ban really be lifted
18:17 <@Marketh> having xanos kline people via pm, if it doesn't even know what they are flooding (since it supposedly doesn't "spy" on pms), then there could be a lot of potential accidental klines
18:17 <@Marketh> already happens enough when it's NOT in pm
18:18 <@Dan> indeed
18:19 <@Dan> the more xanos is made to detect, the more accidental k-lines there will be
18:20 <@Marketh> Then shouldn't klines from xanos from pm flooding be disabled? Since there's no way to prove whether it was accidental or not
18:20 <@Dan> should we compromise users in favor of getting rid of all the spam?
18:20 <@Marketh> You can't always just take peoples word for it
18:21 <@Marketh> People can just shove people on ignore if they dont want to be spammed in pm
18:21 <@Dan> Marketh: No I can't, but I can sense this flood protection can give a lot of false positives.
18:21 <@Dan> I flooded 5 lines in #social to test it, and got k-lined
18:21 <@Dan> 5 lines
18:21 <@Marketh> it's already been proven xanos is pretty unpredictable at times
18:21 <@Dan> yeah
18:22 <@Marketh> at least when it concerns a channel kline we can see what happened
18:22 <@Marketh> I'm just saying, in the case that's a pm flood, there's no way to prove whether the ban was worthy or just somebody pasting a large sentence from a website or something innocent like that
18:22 <@Dan> yes, we've already confirmed this, no need to repeat. :)
18:23 <@Marketh> Yes, but nothing is being done about it
18:23 <@Marketh> This is the actual problem I am pointing out
18:24 <@Dan> well it's not like I can do anything about it. That's a bikcmp thing
18:24 <@Dan> bikcmp: removal of PM flood protection from Xanos.
18:24 <@Marketh> Oh I know, I wasn't appealing to you directly, just in general. Since everyone else is here
18:24 <@Marketh> and apparently bikcmp is being all idle
18:41 <@`> is xanos similiar to that of bopm?
18:50 <@bikcmp> `: 19:05:19 Ignored ` for nickflood.
18:51 <@bikcmp> Dan: ok
18:51 <@bikcmp> Dan: the pm flood detection is /VERY/ hard to trigger.
18:51 <@bikcmp> literally.
18:51 <@bikcmp> it is /extremely/ hard.
18:51 <@bikcmp> you need to be doing some hard core flooding to trigger it.
18:52 <@bikcmp> like, pasting a wall of text for 1 minute at 1 message/second.
18:52 <@bikcmp> but, if there are a /lot/ of pm's coming towards me, then xanos picks it up
18:52 <@bikcmp> and klines it with botnets.
18:52 <@bikcmp> and the pm limit lowers.
18:54 <@`> bikcmp: lolfail
18:54 <@`> bikcmp: but regardless
18:54 <@`> bikcmp: i have a server for wolfram
18:55 <@bikcmp> `: ah
18:55 <@bikcmp> `: nice
18:55 <@bikcmp> `: i was able to get one in NY
18:55 <@bikcmp> actually
18:55 <@`> ah, well
18:55 <@`> i'm already in the process of setting it up.
18:55 <@bikcmp> `: if you want to throw it anyway, i mean
18:55 <@bikcmp> i could certainly use it for the production of the next service
18:55 <@`> or
18:55 <@`> have it be another server on the hub
18:56 <@`> dongs4u.lax.
18:57 <@bikcmp> `: we already have 2 backups
18:57 <@`> can't hurt to have another
18:57 <@`> ;)
18:57 <@bikcmp> `: what i'm saying is maybe use it for a web application server
18:57 <@bikcmp> `: it can: gets overly complex ;p
18:57 <@`> lol
18:57 <@bikcmp> (ikr)
18:57 <@bikcmp> lol
18:57 <@`> do it
18:57 <@`> do BOTH
18:57 <@`> it's a 4-core, damn it
18:57 <@bikcmp> `: like i said, i'll use it for an application server
18:57 <@`> (i think, thats what sue said once)
18:58 <@`> so app swerver
18:58 <@`> what specifically?
18:58 <@`> and unreal makes it very trivial to add in servers
18:58 <@`> charybdis really does overcomplicate things
18:58 <@`> ._________.
18:59 <@bikcmp> `: 19:56:57  <@`> and unreal makes it very trivial to add in servers
18:59 <@bikcmp> `: i'm sure it's the same process
18:59 <@bikcmp> lol
18:59 <@bikcmp> you make a c:
18:59 <@bikcmp> spanningtree (it's an inspircd feature, no idea if unreal does it) is fucko
19:00 <@Dan> bikcmp: I know for a fact, that xanos is triggered my PM flood notices in the console, and they aren't as hard to trigger as you think. I can trigger one easily
19:00 <@bikcmp> Dan: yes
19:00 <@bikcmp> Dan: what it does is basically if xanos has a 'point' rating for you higher than the threshold
19:00 <@bikcmp> it'll akill you.
19:00 <@`> bikcmp: yeah, c:line
19:00 <@`> bikcmp: its so easy to add in
19:00 <@bikcmp> Dan: it is rather hard to trigger one unless you're doing something outragously stupid
19:00 <@`> and have it come up
19:00 <@bikcmp> `: yes, i know :P
19:01 <@`> bikcmp: so lets do it
19:01 <@bikcmp> `: can you set rdns to it
19:01 <@`> probably not
19:01 <@bikcmp> then yeah
19:01 <@bikcmp> db/application server it is
19:01 <@`> prob is
19:02 <@`> i'm already using :80
19:02 <@bikcmp> `: then db server
19:02 <@`> we're using my single IP
19:02 <@bikcmp> i use very redundant databases
19:02 <@`> :P
19:03 <@`> then you'll get a slice
19:04 <@Dan> you won't link an ircd just because it doesn't have rdns? that seems kinda dumb, but whatever
19:04 <@`> ^
19:04 <@bikcmp> Dan: well
19:04 <@bikcmp> Dan: i also don't link tons and tons of ircds when it isn't really needed
19:04 <@bikcmp> Dan: i need a database server anyway
19:04 <@`> oh come on
19:04 <@bikcmp> for 300 users i'd say 3 servers, 4 servers are ok
19:04 <@`> it'd be nice to have one in the LAX area
19:05 <@bikcmp> `: alyx gave me one in the lax
19:05 <@bikcmp> systeminplace
19:05 <@Dan> you forget about UK's reliability
19:05 <@bikcmp> Dan: oh right
19:05 <@bikcmp> Dan: the ipv6 is fucko
19:05 <@`> meh.
19:05 <@Dan> not my fault
19:05 <@bikcmp> yeah
19:05 <@bikcmp> `: oh
19:05 <@bikcmp> `: do you have ipv6?
19:05 <@bikcmp> if you do then we need that
19:06 <@`> no, just a hurricane electric 6to4
19:06 <@bikcmp> hm
19:06 <@`> done at the router level
19:06 <@bikcmp> `: HE blocks port 6667 too
19:06 <@bikcmp> bah
19:06 <@Dan> HE didn't block 6667 last I checked. sure it wasn't the provider?
19:06 <@bikcmp> Dan: they do
19:06 <@bikcmp> they restrict irc access
19:07 <@bikcmp> it sucks
19:07 <@Dan> I've had ircds linked using HE tunnels before
19:07 <@bikcmp> Dan: how long ago
19:07 <@bikcmp> this happened very recently
19:07 <@Dan> this year
19:07 <@bikcmp> actually
19:07 <@bikcmp> `: how old is that tunnel
19:07 <@bikcmp> when did you make it
19:07 <@bikcmp> if it's old enough we have it
19:08 <@`> i'm checking.
19:08 <@`> 25 May 2012
19:08 <@`> i had to recreate.

19:08 <@bikcmp> fwiw
19:08 <@bikcmp> if you don't believe me.
19:09 <@bikcmp> `: and, pre october 11 2011
19:09 <@bikcmp> so yeah
19:09 <@`> so
19:09 <@`> i'll have to get Sage cert
19:09 <@bikcmp> sure
19:09 <@bikcmp> `: i still don't think we really need one in lax
19:09 <@bikcmp> but whatever
19:10 <@bikcmp> you're already using port 80, which is the port i'm really after
19:10 -!- Marketh is now known as Mark|afk
19:12 <@`> just went to Explorer level
19:12 <@bikcmp> nice

19:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: oh, right
19:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i have a suprise for you
19:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: sane rdns!
19:19 <@JStoker> <@bikcmp> Dan: the pm flood detection is /VERY/ hard to trigger. # Uhhhh
19:20 <@Dan> yeah...
19:20 <@bikcmp> JStoker: imo.
19:20 <@bikcmp> unless you're being a complete twit
19:20 <@bikcmp> imo
19:20 <@bikcmp> although this is irondust
19:20 <@bikcmp> lol
19:20 <@JStoker> Sorry, but it isn't terribly hard to do ;-p
19:21 <@JStoker> bikcmp, bah, you didn't set the rdns, did you
19:21 <@bikcmp> i did indeed
19:22 <@bikcmp> JStoker: :)
19:22 <@bikcmp> jason@149-255-104-67:~$ host 69.55.55.235

19:22 <@JStoker> eg, why bother
19:22 <@bikcmp> eh?
19:22 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i know pyfibot freaks out if you don't do rdns right
19:22 <@JStoker> oh jesus
19:23 <@bikcmp> ikr
19:23 <@bikcmp> lol
19:23 <@JStoker> why not just /not bother/ with rdns then?
19:23 <@JStoker> why not, you know, use the ircd name, or the hostname, or the provider or something
19:23 <@bikcmp> i used both the ip and name because sometimes there are two ips to each machine
19:23 <@bikcmp> or more.
19:24 <@JStoker> uh
19:24 <@JStoker> surely <ip>.<name>.id.net would be more sensible
19:24 <@JStoker> not to mention, just adding the last octet, or something would also work, if it has to...
19:24 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i could change it since i have control over it
19:25 <@JStoker> And, i'd suggest having the primary ip be just <name>.id.net, if you want to be brilliant
19:25 <@`> yeah
19:25 <@JStoker> bikcmp, and you don't have control of the in-addr part of the zone?
19:25 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what do you mean
19:25 <@`> i usually do servername.location.fqdn.tld
19:25 <@bikcmp> the in-addr i asked them to cname to
19:25 <@bikcmp> i requested a cname rather than ptr
19:25 <@bikcmp> see: 68.104.255.149.in-addr.arpa is an alias for 68.104.255.149.in-addr.irondust.net.
19:25 <@JStoker> or, why not say 'ok, can i have 192.0.2.5 ptr'd to pie.id.net plz?' and leave it? much simpler
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: let me ask you a question
19:26 <@bikcmp> does rdns in any way affect you
19:26 <@bikcmp> :-P
19:26 <@JStoker> bikcmp, yes, i do know how to read. part of me wonders /why/ the heck you'd want that. (for non-abusive reasons, anyway.)
19:26 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Then why the hell tell me about it? :-)
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so that if you disagree i can change it :-P
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: because you tend to hate it
19:26 <@bikcmp> "wtf bikcmp"
19:26 <@bikcmp> so i wanted to see what you found to complain about
19:26 <@JStoker> If you don't want my opinion, don't ask for it
19:26 <@bikcmp> duly noted
19:28 <@bikcmp> anyway.
19:29 <@JStoker> And anyway, /everyone/ else survives perfectly fine by just going 'hey, can you ptr 198.51.100.63 to bunnies.irondust.net, thanks', and just leaving it at that? Heh. Must just be me thinking this is slightly pointless.
19:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: uh
19:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: most people do it this way.
19:29 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Such as?
19:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: freenode, google, oftc.
19:30 <@Dan> I have no customers that do it that way
19:30 <@JStoker> and of course, i don't have a sane dns client here, heh
19:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: :P
19:30 <@Dan> and you're not google, and who would want to be freenode of oftc?
19:30 <@Dan> or*
19:30 <@bikcmp> Dan: oftc is nice
19:30 <@bikcmp> freenode wtf
19:30 <@bikcmp> google is, eh
19:30 <@bikcmp> getting bad
19:31 <@bikcmp> jason@149-255-104-67:~$ host 64.62.190.36
19:31 <@bikcmp> 36.190.62.64.in-addr.arpa is an alias for 36.0-24.190.62.64.in-addr.arpa.
19:31 <@bikcmp> 36.0-24.190.62.64.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer zombie-scan.oftc.net.
19:31 <@bikcmp> :p
19:31 <@bikcmp> i'd say out of all of them we do it the sanest.
19:31 <@JStoker> Yes, That's not the same thing.
19:31 <@JStoker> No, you really don''t
19:31 <@bikcmp> yeah ok
19:32 <@JStoker> With theirs, you virtually have the entire dns path which you can use to query for the second one.
19:32 <@JStoker> Ours? You have to go resolve from the root again!
19:32 <@JStoker> And bah, vmware decided not to start
19:32 <@Dan> oftc prolly has actual control over their zone, as opposed to IP cnames
19:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 
19:33 <@bikcmp> jason@149-255-104-67:~$ host 72.32.146.138
19:33 <@bikcmp> 138.146.32.72.in-addr.arpa is an alias for fusion-138.rev.oftc.net.
19:33 <@bikcmp> fusion-138.rev.oftc.net domain name pointer photon.oftc.net.
19:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: :P
19:34 <@JStoker> And even if they don't, how often do they change their zones around? I mean, I can't remember the last time I renamed a ptr record...
19:34 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i like to have proper reverse ;p
19:34 <@bikcmp> we could go back and forth all day
19:34 <@bikcmp> i don't have the time to do
19:35 <@bikcmp> 20:31:11  -!- ST [~webchat@24.192.vk.opz] has joined #terraria
19:35 <@bikcmp> 20:31:16  < ST> Hi.
19:35 <@bikcmp> 20:32:26  < bikcmp> hi
19:35 <@bikcmp> 20:33:02  < ST> Hey, I know you!
19:35 <@bikcmp> 20:33:54  < bikcmp> you do?
19:35 <@JStoker> For that matter, with relation to the 36.0-24.62.64.in-addr.arpa -style address, do you actually know why they do it?
19:35 <@bikcmp> yes.
19:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: they do it for a range
19:36 <@JStoker> Because they get a NS record delegated to them. Not a cname.
19:36 <@JStoker> And, I'd expect that one was imposed by upstream, not oftc themselves, but that's purely speculation at this point
19:37  * bikcmp yawns
19:37 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so how was your day
19:37 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Eh.
19:37 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Not terribly bad, to be honest. For once.
19:37 <@bikcmp> !
19:37 <@bikcmp> jstoker? having a decent day?
19:37 <@bikcmp> this must be stopped
19:37 <@JStoker> Getting slightly worse battling with openwrt to get a dns client...
19:37 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Hahaha
19:37  * bikcmp intervention
19:38 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I managed to get my erlang 'compiler' (ok, it's a small script which just goes and wraps around the preprocessor, and the compiler. However, it lets me fiddle with the AST, so it'll let me do cool stuff later... If I could only remember what it was)
19:38 <@`> suddenly space
19:38 <@bikcmp> `: nice
19:38 <@JStoker> bikcmp, :-p
19:38 <@`> at first, i couldnt use this room

19:39 <@JStoker> Bah, I need someone to write an app to teleport my phone to me
19:39 <@bikcmp> ok
19:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's in python.
19:39 <@JStoker> that is possible, yeah?
19:39 <@bikcmp> uh

19:40 <@bikcmp> so easy
19:40 <@bikcmp> so powerful
19:40 <@bikcmp> lol
19:40 <@JStoker> ... Bah. You clearly haven't used erlang!
19:41 <@bikcmp> eh
19:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i hate the way erlang does some stuff
19:41 <@bikcmp> it's overly complex.
19:41 <@JStoker> Not really
19:42 <@JStoker> But anyway, I'm off.
19:42 <@bikcmp> night
19:42 <@JStoker> If you see Alyx, tell her I was looking for her ;-p

00:15 <@bikcmp> tomorrow i'll know
00:15 <@`> bummar. okay, lets see.
00:15 <@`> anyway, im gone for now.
00:15 <@bikcmp> ah
00:15 <@bikcmp> bye
00:15 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i <3 wp
00:16 <@bikcmp> lol
00:18 <@bikcmp> `: i do think microsoft is having a hard time with the load
00:18 <@bikcmp> This page is temporarily unavailable
00:18 <@bikcmp> We're sorry, there was a problem showing this page. We experienced some technical difficulties retrieving the content.
00:18 <@bikcmp> Please try this page again in a few minutes.
00:18 <@bikcmp> lol
00:20 <@bikcmp> `: yeah
00:20 <@bikcmp> they definitely are
00:20 <@bikcmp> that or my account isn't fully propgated
00:20 <@bikcmp> my phone is having a hard time doing stuff too
00:20 <@bikcmp> "The Windows Live ID service is having problems right now (500).  Please try again in 30 seconds."
01:01 <@`> haha to those who depend on it for critical stuff
01:01 -!- Dan [~Daniel@staff/danp] has quit [Quit: Rejoice, for I am gone!]
01:01 <@`> coming in from fone fyi
01:06 <@bikcmp> `: fone?
01:06 <@`> phone
01:06 <@bikcmp> also yeah
01:06 <@bikcmp> it's over twitter
01:06 <@bikcmp> it's failing big time
01:06 <@bikcmp> lol
01:06 <@`> heh
01:06 <@`> msft for you
01:06 <@`> they also majorly fucked up the danger migration
01:07 <@`> luckily when i heard of the msft acquisition of danger, i promptly went to android (ADP1)
01:07 <@bikcmp> `: the danger?
01:07 <@`> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_(company)
01:08 <@bikcmp> ah
01:08 <@bikcmp> `: tbh i think msft is heading in the right direction
01:08 <@bikcmp> i'm sure that they'll get much better.
01:09 <@`> In early October 2009, a server malfunction or technician error at Danger's data centers resulted in the loss of all Sidekick user data. As Sidekicks store users' data on Danger's servers—versus using local storage—users lost contact directories, calendars, photos, and all other media not locally backed up. In an October 10 letter to subscribers, Microsoft expressed its doubt that any data would be recovered.
01:09 <@bikcmp> sidekick? what's that
01:09 <@bikcmp> <.<
01:09 <@bikcmp> lol
01:09 <@bikcmp> `: tbh i love my wp phone
01:09 <@bikcmp> `: and the live seems back to normal
01:09 <@bikcmp> lesson learned by danger ;rp
01:09 <@`> my first phone, basically
01:10 <@`> it was capable of email, and etc
01:10 <@`> at the time, it was :o
01:10 <@`> here, let me show
01:10 <@bikcmp> palm centro :P
01:10 <@bikcmp> `: dude
01:10 <@bikcmp> `: i know what a sidekick is
01:10 <@bikcmp> i was joking
01:10 <@bikcmp> lol
01:10 <@bikcmp> `: to be honest i think it was because of my account change
01:10 <@bikcmp> after i got the email a minute ago saying it's complete, everything works fine
01:10 <@`> blurry as fuck, but here it is
01:10 <@`> http://dgd.io/KNbE
01:11 <@`> my original Color Sidekick
01:11 <@`> treated me VERY well for a very long time
01:11 <@`> then i eventually got an sidekick lx
01:11 <@`> http://dgd.io/dXZE
01:12 <@`> but yeah
01:12 <@`> i miss those, actually
01:12 <@`> damn.
01:12 <@`> nostalgiabomb
01:13 <@`> you know.
01:13 <@bikcmp> ah
01:13 <@bikcmp> yeah
01:13 <@bikcmp> `: wp is awesome
01:13 <@bikcmp> it really 'just works'.
01:13 <@`> i'm DESPERATE to get a split-key keyboard (those ergonomic keyboards)
01:13 <@bikcmp> no bullshit.
01:13 <@bikcmp> `: get one
01:13 <@bikcmp> i personally hate them
01:13 <@`> can't
01:13 <@`> no money
01:13 <@bikcmp> why?
01:13 <@bikcmp> oh
01:13 <@bikcmp> what happened /w sue
01:13 <@`> because i have to get a $160 bag
01:13 <@`> :P
01:13 <@`> he moved out yesterday
01:14 <@`> on a bus
01:14 <@bikcmp> happy?
01:14 <@bikcmp> lol
01:14 <@`> eh
01:14 <@`> neutral, i guess
01:14 <@bikcmp> `: he's probably like, half way there now
01:14 <@bikcmp> lol
01:14 <@`> no, hes there now, im sure of it
01:14 <@bikcmp> :((((((( i need to take a bus?!? :(
01:14 <@bikcmp> lol
01:14 <@`> it only takes 5-6 hours to get there
01:14 <@`> lols
01:14 <@`> yeah
01:14 <@`> anyway
01:14 <@bikcmp> why can't your rich daddy drive you :(
01:14 <@`> no dad.
01:14 <@bikcmp> `: (you get the point...)
01:15 <@bikcmp> that's the vibe i got off of him.
01:16 <@`> yea i guess
01:16 <@`> ugh, most of them are 4000s and 7000s
01:17 <@`> i want the older one.
01:17  * ` is looking on ebay :P
01:18 <@`> this is a bit eh eh, i kinda want the older white keyboard
01:18 <@`> the big clunker
01:19 <@`> oh i might ahve found it
01:19 <@`> "msft natural elite"
01:19 <@`> pft
01:19  * bikcmp pretends to have any idea what you're saying
01:19 <@bikcmp> lol
01:19 <@`> pft
01:19 <@bikcmp> pft
01:20 <@`> this is what im talking about, bitch
01:20 <@`> http://dgd.io/KozQ
01:20 <@`> :p
01:20 <@bikcmp> i'm absorbed with care
01:21 <@bikcmp> ;)
01:21 <@`> pft
01:21 <@`> but yeah
01:21 <@`> thats basically what i want
01:22 <@bikcmp> `: hm
01:22 <@bikcmp> i hate those
01:22 <@bikcmp> but w/e
01:22 <@bikcmp> lol
01:23 <@`> so frustrating
01:23 <@`> i need to find my particular keyboard
01:23 <@`> thats in the picture
01:23 <@`> i showed you
01:24 <@`> FUCK YEA

01:24 <@`> YAY YAY FOUND IT

01:25 <@`> }:A
01:25 <@`> SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
01:25 <@`> its on ebay and cheap
01:26 <@`> though theres a wireless version of it
01:26 <@`> should i?
01:26 <@`> 2 of them for $39.99/free shipping
01:26 <@bikcmp> uh
01:26 <@bikcmp> i don't know
01:26 <@bikcmp> do you think you'll use it
01:27 <@bikcmp> if so
01:27 <@bikcmp> yes
01:27 <@`> oh yeah i would definitely use it
01:27 <@`> i love ergonomics
01:27 <@`> but for now im probably gonna just get the ps/2 wired one
01:27 <@`> then get an cheap ps/2-to-usb adapter
01:27 <@`> then im pretty set.
01:31 <@`> anyway
01:31 <@`> enough of that bullshit
01:31 <@`> time for making swervers.
01:31 <@bikcmp> time to sleep
01:31 <@bikcmp> `: i'm going to the doctor's tomorrow
01:31 <@bikcmp> er
01:31 <@bikcmp> today
01:32 <@`> :P
01:32 <@`> too bad you wont be up while i bring this thing up
01:32 <@bikcmp> woah.
01:32 <@bikcmp> <.<
01:32 <@bikcmp> lol
01:32 <@bikcmp> `: well
01:32 <@bikcmp> night
01:33 <@bikcmp> pm me access or something.
01:34 <@bikcmp> `: do you get the ringing in your ears?
01:34 <@bikcmp> decided to watch utube vids
01:39 <@`> no
01:39 <@`> not unless a M80 exploded near me
01:42 <@bikcmp> `: i hear constant ringing in my ears
01:50 <@`> here goes!
01:50 <@`> i'm gonna go first light on this dongs4u
01:50 <@`> i have NO idea what's on the drive
01:50 <@`> booting.
01:51 <@`> okay, predictably "DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER"
01:51 <@`> now i need to find my debian cd
01:53 <@`> lets see if it'll read my old debian squeeze dvd
01:53 <@`> looks like yup
02:08 <@`> eh
02:08 <@`> fuck it
02:08 <@`> i stopped the install in the middle
02:08 <@`> and i'm burning a new disc with 64-bit shit
02:09 <@bikcmp> whatever works man
02:09 <@bikcmp> `: so what
02:09 <@bikcmp> `: am i going to have the entire box?
02:10 <@bikcmp> (if no, i would want a vm)
02:10 <@`> a fairly large vm
02:10 <@`> :)
02:10 <@bikcmp> works for me
02:10 <@`> cd is verifying.
02:10 <@bikcmp> verifying cds are for wimps
02:10 <@bikcmp> do it like a man
02:10 <@`> lols
02:10 <@`> fine
02:10 <@bikcmp> if something breaks blame the disk
02:10  * ` skips
02:10 <@bikcmp> `: playing ;p
02:10 <@`> finishing burn
02:13 <@`> oh yeah
02:13 <@`> install is going faster
02:13 <@`> yay x86
02:13 <@`> *x86-64
02:13 <@`> i decided to name the HN ayu
02:14 <@bikcmp> `: microsoft is having some serious probs
02:14 <@bikcmp> `: ZuneSetupPkg.exeUnknown network error.

02:14 <@bikcmp> i'm getting tons of 500's
02:14 <@bikcmp> lol
02:25 <@`> lols
02:26 <@`> i just created a separate partition *just* for VMs
02:27  * ` selects mirror.csua.berkeley.edu
02:30 <@bikcmp> `:

02:30 <@bikcmp> lol
02:30 <@`> heh
02:30 <@`> i'm probably wrong on the fqdn
02:30 <@`> i deselected everything on the software install step
02:30 <@`> so it's basically only core system
02:31 <@`> not even ssh.
02:33 <@`> ok
02:33 <@`> it's at console now
02:33 <@`> i'm aptitude installing all the essential stuff
02:33 <@`> build-essential toilet sl molly-guard, etc
02:35 <@`> bikcmp: ah, it was linux.csua.berkeley.edu
02:35 <@`> ;)
02:40 <@`> sshd is now up
02:44 <@`> fuck
02:44 <@`> i just found out
02:44 <@`> The Debian 6.0 release notes include a warning that for Debian 7.0 (wheezy) it is planned to no longer support OpenVZ.
02:44 <@`> fucking fuck
02:45 <@`> im pretty pissed.
02:45 <@bikcmp> :(
02:46 <@bikcmp> `: rip openvz
02:46 <@bikcmp> :)
02:46 <@bikcmp> `: you weren't planning on using openvz as your hypervisor
02:46 <@bikcmp> right?
02:52 <@`> yes.
02:52 <@`> but now i'm using xen.
02:52 <@`> just setup LVM so xen can take advantage of it.
02:52 <@bikcmp> `: ok, make sure it's xen or full virtualization
02:52 <@bikcmp> i'm glad ovz didn't work
02:53 <@`> rofl
02:53 <@bikcmp> `: we can't use an openvz server.
02:53 <@`> the cpu supports virt
02:53 <@`> so xen should be able to use that
02:53 <@bikcmp> i'm sure it can
02:53 <@bikcmp> use hyperv
02:53 <@bikcmp> <.<
02:53 <@bikcmp> lol
02:53 <@`> fuck anything msft
02:53 <@`> srsly
02:54 <@bikcmp> `: why?
02:54 <@`> i plainly hate msft.
02:54 <@`> i CANT not have a native console to the system
03:13 <@`> okay
03:13 <@`> it's booting into the xen kernel
03:14 <@`> it's complaining XENBUS: unable to read cpu state
06:36 <@JStoker> bikcmp, cfs? Crappy filesystem?
09:25 -!- Marketh [~Marketh-@staff/Marketh] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
14:05 <@`> eh fuck xen
14:05 -!- Dan [~Daniel@staff/danp] has joined #staff
14:05 -!- mode/#staff [+o Dan] by ChanServ
14:05 <@`> i'm going to be using xenserver
14:05 <@`> at least, the free version
14:06 <@Dan> xenserver... why not use regular xen?
14:11  * ` shrugs
14:11 <@`> i'm too lazy
14:11 <@`> and i dont know xen that well in the first place
14:12 <@`> xenserver should be able to bring me up on xen
14:12 <@`> unless someone is willing to school me in xen
14:13 <@`> :p
14:15 <@Dan> xenserver will not teach you xen. xen and xenserver are not the same at all, they just share a similar name, and are owned by the same company
14:15 <@`> i know
14:15 <@`> i'm talking concepts
14:15 <@`> i dont even understand the dom0 bullshit
14:15 <@`> i'm unfortunately versed in openvz
14:15 <@`> and debian is depreciating that
14:16 <@Dan> dom0 is the OS on the physical machine. it's your host OS, the real machine. the domU's are the VMs.
14:16 <@`> yeah.. THAT much i know
14:16 <@`> the documentation is too confusing to follow
14:16 <@`> as to the *actual* setup
14:16 <@`> of xen on the server
14:17 <@Dan> well don't use the documentation, it's shit
14:17 <@`> thats the problem
14:17 <@`> i have nothing else
14:17 <@Dan> yes you do. what OS are you using?
14:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 07:35:05  <@JStoker> bikcmp, cfs? Crappy filesystem?
14:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: clustered
14:17 <@bikcmp> fucker.
14:17 <@bikcmp> ;p
14:17 <@JStoker> Lulz
14:17 <@`> Dan: debian
14:18 <@`> i didnt nuke the system yet with xenserver
14:18 <@Dan> cool, let me get you some useful crap
14:18 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Enjoy ;-p
14:18 <@`> so lemme boot it up
14:18 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
14:18 <@Dan> undo everything first off, since you'll want to start right
14:18 <@`> Dan: not a problem, i can reinstall
14:18 <@`> Dan: what's the specifics i need to do?
14:19 <@Dan> depends on if you plan on selling these or not. I'd assume this is a personal project, right?
14:19 <@`> at least one of the domUs will be for quicksilver.id
14:20 <@`> thats the whole point of this, actually :P
14:20 <@Dan> ok, I suggest having at least 3 IPs
14:21 <@Dan> 1 for the host, 1 for the quicksilver VPS, and 1 for your own vps, since you will not want to run tasks on the host with vpses running on it, due to adverse side effects
14:21 <@`> i'm gonna be NAT'ing this fucker, unfortunately
14:22 <@`> only the quicksilver VM will be exposed to the intarbutts
14:22 <@Dan> you need at least 2 IPs regardless
14:22 <@Dan> 1 has to be assigned to the vm, and the other to the host, so you can access the host yourself
14:23 <@`> right.
14:23 <@`> shouldn't be an issue, i can assign it IPs out of my 10.0.1.x subnet
14:23 <@Dan> ...
14:23 <@`> then NAT/pfwd the quicksilver to the internuts
14:24 <@`> and only access the other crap locally
14:24 <@`> again, this has to be NAT'd
14:24 <@`> i only have one internet IP
14:25 <@`> if you dont count my hurricane electric 6to4 tunnel
14:25 <@Dan> why can't you buy a second? most providers will be more than happy to sell you one if you open a ticket
14:25 <@`> uh
14:25 <@`> this is at home
14:25 <@bikcmp> it's some vz home ip
14:25 <@`> and the only server i have available without spending more money
14:25 <@bikcmp> Dan: i plan on using it for database usage.
14:25 <@`> ^
14:26 <@`> like i said, it wont be fully utilized
14:26 <@bikcmp> Dan: i don't intend on using it for an ircd unless it proves to be extremely reliable
14:26 <@bikcmp> Dan: it'll be used for an encrypted database in which it doesn't matter if that machine dies
14:26 <@bikcmp> since there'll be more to pick up.
14:26 <@`> bikcmp: yeah, i'll show that it's reliable because lol redundancies in place
14:26 <@`> regardless
14:27 <@`> i need to setup xen or xenserver - what should we do?
14:27 <@`> i'm ready to do either right now
14:27 <@`> i also have a debian cd ready to do clean install of debian as well
14:27 <@Dan> http://www.howtoforge.com/paravirtualization-with-xen-4.0-on-debian-squeeze-amd64
14:28 <@Dan> assign both 10.x IPs.
14:28 <@`> eh squeeze
14:28 <@`> but ok
14:28 <@Dan> you said debian
14:28 <@`> i have a sid CD
14:28 <@`> :p
14:28 <@Dan> squeeze, sid, same diff
14:28 <@`> made as of yesterday
14:28 <@`> sometimes not
14:28 <@`> but ok, doing now
14:29 <@`> hmm
14:29 <@`> paravirt
14:29 <@Dan> you're gonna run an unstable debian version for this?
14:29 <@`> nope, i'm burning a squeeze CD
14:29 <@`> and
14:29 <@`> this CPU is capable of hardware virt
14:30 <@Dan> doesn't matter. don't use HVM, unless you plan on building your own fucking kernels
14:31 <@`> ah yeah
14:31 <@`> sue was doing that i think
14:31 <@`> no wonder he burnt out
14:31 <@`> oh goody
14:31 <@`> found a squeeze dvd
14:31 <@`> using that.
14:32 <@`> hmm
14:32 <@`> its not 64bit
14:32 <@`> blah.
14:32 <@Dan> just go grab a x86_64 netinst
14:33 <@`> already am
14:33 <@`> :P
14:34 <@`> 6.0.5-amd64
14:37 <@`> Dan: hmm, should i do image-based VMs or LVM-based?
14:38 <@bikcmp> hm
14:38 <@bikcmp> `: i think i'm going to modify accounts.
14:39 <@`> bikcmp: you'd get root of such VM
14:39 <@bikcmp> ok
14:39 <@bikcmp> `: now
14:39 <@bikcmp> let me make sure of something so we don't misunderstand
14:39 <@bikcmp> `: who are you giving the vm to?
14:39 <@`> you.
14:39 <@bikcmp> `: bikcmp, or irondust?
14:40 <@`> both are the same?
14:40 <@bikcmp> no
14:40 <@`> same person, anyway
14:40 <@bikcmp> let me rephrase
14:40 <@`> as in, i'm giving it to you for whatever you want
14:40 <@bikcmp> aka, can i use it for mainly irondust but then some small unrel.. 
14:40 <@bikcmp> ok
14:40 <@bikcmp> yes
14:40 <@bikcmp> `: that was what i meant
14:40 <@`> and once i set this up
14:40 <@bikcmp> strictly for irondust, or to bikcmp to use mainly for irondust but potentially for smaller other things.
14:40 <@`> i will make it as reliable.
14:41 <@bikcmp> Dan and i had a misunderstanding a while ago about something like that
14:41 <@bikcmp> and tbh i acted like an ahole
14:41 <@bikcmp> so i wanted to make it very clear ;_p
14:42 <@`> but ideally
14:42 <@`> i'd like to see it used to 'support' id
14:42 <@bikcmp> `: well
14:42 <@bikcmp> `: here are my plans.
14:42 <@bikcmp> i liked your 'locker' service.
14:42 <@`> droplr
14:42 <@bikcmp> `: so, i've been working very hard on a clustered filesystem.
14:42 <@bikcmp> `: it'll integrate flawlessly with irondust.
14:43 <@bikcmp> i've been working my ass off on this.
14:43 <@`> heh
14:43 <@bikcmp> i'm about to test the database :)
14:43 <@JStoker> lul
14:43 <@bikcmp> `: i'm about to test it on accounts.
14:43 <@bikcmp> and shift accounts. onto our own server
14:43 <@`> >mfw this is the first i've heard of it
14:43 <@bikcmp> then buy the ssl cert
14:43 <@bikcmp> bah.  mfw = ? again
14:43 <@bikcmp> my first words?
14:43 <@`> my face when
14:43 <@bikcmp> oh
14:43 <@bikcmp> anyway yes
14:43 <@bikcmp> `: i'm about to test out the database on accounts.
14:44 <@bikcmp> and port the accounts db over to the db i wrote ;p
14:44 <@`> have fun. :p
14:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: also, the uids are now 20 characters
14:44 <@bikcmp> :-)
14:44 <@`> damn, this mirror is particularly slow
14:44 <@`> i'm capable of 5.8 megabytes/sec
14:44 <@bikcmp> that's it?
14:44 <@bikcmp> lol
14:44 <@`> but it's only doing 200kb
14:44 <@`> ._.
14:45 <@`> why the FUCK
14:45 <@`> every fucking time
14:45 <@`> i use ftp.debian.org or some shit
14:45 <@`> it fucking ALWAYS goes to fucking hammurabi.acc.umu.se
14:45 <@`> fucking .se
14:45 <@JStoker> where are you located in the world?
14:46 <@`> VPN is located in DFW, TX
14:46 <@`> physically LAX, CA

14:46 <@`> bikcmp: showoff
14:46 <@bikcmp> `: want to see showing off?
14:46 <@bikcmp> these are the speeds i used to have
14:46 <@bikcmp> lol
14:46 <@`> heh
14:46 <@JStoker> ` then go use ftp.us.debian.org?
14:46 <@bikcmp> `: speedtest.net/result/948525270.png
14:46 <@bikcmp> `: http://speedtest.net/result/948525270.png
14:46 <@`> JStoker: i did!
14:46 <@`> JStoker: it somehow points me to that shitty .se
14:47 <@`> here.
14:47 <@bikcmp> i love sweeden
14:47 <@bikcmp> :-p
14:47 <@JStoker> Then try ftp.se.debian.org? ;-P
14:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i use it
14:47 <@bikcmp> in fact
14:47 <@`> fuck .se
14:47 <@bikcmp> lol
14:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: deb http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main
14:47 <@bikcmp> :-P
14:52 <@bikcmp> ok
14:52 <@bikcmp> JStoker: question for you.
14:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i want something extremely extremely unlikely to collide.
14:53 <@bikcmp> is uuid1 any less likely to collide than uuid4?
14:53 <@bikcmp> uuid1 is time based
14:53 <@bikcmp> 4 is random, i think
14:54 <@JStoker> Depends, is one node generating all the values, or multiple?
14:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: multiple.
14:56 <@JStoker> Then use uuid1
14:56 <@`> okay
14:56 <@`> setting up the machine with debian squeeze now
14:56 <@`> just created LVM
14:56 <@JStoker> Or uuid4, to be honest, won't matter terribly much
14:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
14:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: is uuid1 more/less likely to collide than u4
14:59 <@bikcmp> 4
14:59 <@JStoker> bikcmp, It depends completely on your situation.
14:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hm.
14:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
14:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm just trying to think.
14:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: any good at math?
14:59 <@JStoker> Neither of them are particularly likely to collide.
14:59 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I'm good enough
15:00 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what are the odds of alphanumberic/case sensitive characters totalling 20 characters all at random 
15:00 <@bikcmp> colliding.
15:00 <@bikcmp> is it something that i need to remotely worry about?
15:00 <@bikcmp> lol
15:00 <@JStoker> depends on how they're generated, if they're generated completely randomly, then 36**20
15:00 <@JStoker> uh, 64**20 even
15:01 <@JStoker> <JCSBot> JStoker, 64**20 = 1329227995784915872903807060000000000.0

15:01 <@bikcmp> lol
15:01 <@JStoker> Xanos, Fuck off and die. :-)
15:01 <@bikcmp> JStoker: (i think it likes you)
15:01 <@bikcmp> <.<
15:01 <@bikcmp> lol
15:02 <@JStoker> bikcmp, :-p
15:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so
15:02 <@JStoker> bikcmp, but, if it's /completely/ random, it's 1 in 1329227995784915872903807060000000000.
15:02 <@bikcmp> hm
15:02 <@bikcmp> still a chance.
15:02 <@bikcmp> though i'm probably more likely to die than it collide
15:02 <@bikcmp> lol
15:03 <@JStoker> And assuming that there isn't any correlation between each of the chars too
15:03 <@bikcmp> hm
15:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so, uuid1 it is?
15:04 <@JStoker> That'll probably be fine
15:04 <@bikcmp> k
15:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: actually
15:04 <@bikcmp> uuid1 might be sequential.
15:04 <@bikcmp> shit.
15:04 <@bikcmp> well
15:04 <@bikcmp> tbh
15:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's random enough, isn't it?
15:04 <@bikcmp> lol
15:04 <@bikcmp> that or maybe infuse a bit of random into it
15:04 <@JStoker> Yes, it's a function of the time, and your node id
15:04 <@bikcmp> this will also be used for email verifications
15:04 <@JStoker> and the amount of calls you've used
15:05 <@JStoker> I'd probably not use it for email verification, however
15:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so, it's pretty unlikely that someone can predict the next entity id?
15:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: eh?
15:05 <@bikcmp> why
15:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you'd use uuid4 over uuid1 for emails?
15:05 <@JStoker> No. That's not the same thing as unlikely to collide
15:05 <@JStoker> Yes.
15:05 <@bikcmp> where it doesn't matter if they collide
15:05 <@bikcmp> k
15:05 <@bikcmp> for emails i could not care less
15:05 <@bikcmp> lol
15:05 <@JStoker> (And possibly hash it too, just for fun)
15:05 <@bikcmp> eh
15:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: to be honest
15:05 <@bikcmp> i say ti's hard enough
15:05 <@bikcmp> lol
15:06 <@`> nah
15:06 <@`> uuid1+md5
15:06 <@`> good enough.
15:06  * bikcmp no doey md5
15:06 <@bikcmp> lol
15:06 <@JStoker> ew, md5
15:06 <@bikcmp> ikr
15:06 <@bikcmp> sha512 ftw
15:06 <@bikcmp> lol
15:07 <@JStoker> Nah, Grøstl ftew
15:08 <@bikcmp> ok
15:08 <@bikcmp> cool
15:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: '6895BB0E-DC14-11E1-A2CC-00265E184EF4'
15:08 <@bikcmp> looks nice.
15:08 <@bikcmp> lol
15:08 <@JStoker> lol
15:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hm. should i remove the dashes?
15:08 <@JStoker> Doesn't make any difference
15:08 <@bikcmp> yeah
15:08 <@bikcmp> but i mean, why make it longer
15:09 <@JStoker> Well, unless you're hashing it, then it'd ideally be better to remove hashes, and decode from hex, but anyway
15:09 <@`> 83.1MB in 17 seconds
15:09 <@`> :D
15:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm not hashing it
15:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: the code to accounts. is actually the cleanest it's ever been.
15:09 <@JStoker> ok then ;-p
15:10 <@JStoker> lol, oh god
15:10 <@Dan> `: what is your upload speed?
15:22 <@`> same as my download
15:23 <@`> 35/35, it appears, however, i can sustain 42/38
15:23 <@`> mbits, of course
15:24 <@bikcmp> `: just so you know this db might go really fast
15:24 <@bikcmp> and require a lot of bw...
15:25 <@`> i'll ratelimit at 10mbit
15:25 <@`> fyi
15:25 <@bikcmp> if you want
15:25 <@bikcmp> but then it'll get backlogged
15:25 <@`> yeah, well
15:25 <@`> just sayin'
15:25 <@`> i dont want my internuts swamped that i cant browse reddit
15:25 <@`> :p
15:25 <@bikcmp> well
15:26 <@bikcmp> we'll see
15:26 <@`> ok, so
15:26 <@`> i'll add in another drive

15:29 -!- Dan [~Daniel@staff/danp] has quit [Quit: Rejoice, for I am gone!]
15:30 <@`> okay
15:30 <@`> i've got two drives.
15:30 <@`> 100G and 500G
15:30 <@`> :D
15:30 <@bikcmp> ok
15:30 <@bikcmp> awesome
15:31 <@bikcmp> `: fwiw, try to be nice on the disk space since it'll hold binaries
15:31 <@`> you'll get the 100G
15:31 <@bikcmp> if you can
15:31 <@bikcmp> ah
15:31 <@bikcmp> nice
15:31 <@bikcmp> also

15:31 <@`> okay, adding in drives nao
15:32 <@bikcmp> `: ok, cool.
15:32 <@bikcmp> i'm rebuilding the database
15:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: question about salts.

15:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that'll work?
15:36 <@bikcmp> even though it isn't ascii
15:36 <@JStoker> uh, for what?
15:37 <@bikcmp> as a password hash.
15:37 <@JStoker> uh, for what?
15:37 <@bikcmp> what do you maen
15:37 <@JStoker> what are you passing it to?
15:37 <@bikcmp> mean
15:37 <@bikcmp> JStoker: uh, a database?
15:37 <@bikcmp> might require ascii
15:37 <@JStoker> well, surely that depends on the database?
15:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what do i do if i require an ascii hash
15:38 <@bikcmp> which i'm 99% sure i do.
15:38 <@JStoker> you create one?
15:38 <@bikcmp> how do i do it securely?
15:38 <@bikcmp> you gave me a way to do it.
15:38 <@bikcmp> application.crypt.crypt("hi",application.getsalt().replace('\0',''))
15:38 <@JStoker> application.?
15:38 <@bikcmp> oh
15:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that's just the env
15:39 <@alyx> wat
15:39 <@JStoker> uh huh
15:39 <@JStoker> what's getsalt() defined as
15:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 
15:39 <@bikcmp> def getsalt(): return "$6$"+strxor(randpoolobj.get_bytes(1024),os.urandom(8192))
15:39 <@JStoker> and, .replace('\0', '') is generally not advised, unless you're sure the salt is more than long enough
15:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you're the one who told me to do \0
15:39 <@bikcmp> lol
15:39 <@bikcmp> like, less than 7 days ago
15:39 <@bikcmp> lol
15:39 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I highly doubt that.
15:40 <@JStoker> application.crypt.crypt?
15:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 
15:40 <@bikcmp> irclogs/2012/irondust/#staff.07-03.log:04:35:53 <@JStoker> getsalt().replace('\0',''), and make sure the salt is long enough
15:40 <@JStoker> Yes, and that's 7 days ago?
15:40 <@JStoker> and make sure the salt is long enough
15:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and, sorry
15:40 <@bikcmp> bad with time
15:40 <@bikcmp> lol
15:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: anyway.  ok.
15:41 <@bikcmp> how do I make it ascii?
15:41 <@bikcmp> base64?
15:41 <@bikcmp> iirc you told me never to base64
15:46 <@`> okay
15:46 <@`> lets see if it'll pick up the 100G drive
15:46 <@`> it's an maxtor piece of shit
15:46 <@`> :P
15:46 <@`> i mean that lovingly
15:47 <@`> hmm
15:47 <@`> i'm getting XENBUS: Unable to read cpu state
15:53 <@bikcmp> wtf
15:53 <@bikcmp> lol
15:56 <@`> right.
15:56 <@`> i'm nuking the drive and then adding it to the LVM VG

16:39 <@bikcmp> i'm trying to really do this right
16:39 <@`> i think i offer ssl certs
16:39 <@`> lemme see what the pricings like
16:40 <@bikcmp> `: i'd rather buy from you, of course

16:41 <@`> the certs' are from comodo

16:41 <@`> geotrust
16:41 <@bikcmp> and?
16:41 <@bikcmp> `: oh
16:41 <@bikcmp> `: does that mean i get that green thing?
16:41 <@bikcmp> IronDust (U)
16:41 <@bikcmp> S
16:42 <@`> yeah
16:42 <@bikcmp> hm
16:42 <@`> full ssl (https)
16:42 <@bikcmp> `: no, i mean
16:42 <@bikcmp> there's blue for secure
16:42 <@bikcmp> and then green for verified
16:42 <@`> yep
16:42 <@bikcmp> like, blue would be irondust.net
16:42 <@bikcmp> green would be IronDust (US)
16:42 <@`> but fyi
16:42 <@`> you can get a perfectly valid free ssl
16:42 <@bikcmp> i need to be a registered entity to have it though, no?
16:42 <@bikcmp> `: yeah, i'm aware
16:42 <@`> http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/free-ssl-certificate.html
16:43 <@bikcmp> i'd rather give you the business :-P
16:43 <@`> :P
16:43 <@bikcmp> i'm assuming you get commission or something
16:43 <@bikcmp> hmmm.
16:44 <@`> yes, a little
16:44 <@bikcmp> eh
16:44 <@bikcmp> how much?
16:44 <@`> and im double checking on the requirements
16:44 <@bikcmp> $1 out of the $10 i give?
16:44 <@bikcmp> `: you may need to be a registered licensed entity
16:44 <@bikcmp> make sure that isn't true
16:45 <@bikcmp> id isn't (yet)
16:45 <@`> doesn't look like it, no
16:45 <@`> so you should be good
16:45 <@bikcmp> hm
16:45 <@bikcmp> let me see how freessl works out
16:45 <@`> yup
16:45 <@bikcmp> if it doesn't, i'l give you some business
16:45 <@bikcmp> `: how would you put ssl on multiple servers/
16:45 <@bikcmp> multiple certs?
16:46 <@bikcmp> hm
16:46 <@bikcmp> `: it looks like it's a /test/ cert
16:46 <@`> yes
16:46 <@bikcmp> only works for 90 days
16:46 <@`> yes
16:46 <@bikcmp> after 90 days then what
16:46 <@bikcmp> i need to pay?
16:46 <@`> good enough for yout o come up with something
16:46 <@`> yep
16:46 <@bikcmp> yeah
16:47 <@`> and due to the nature of SSL
16:47 <@`> it requires an static IP for each ssl'd site
16:47 <@bikcmp> no it doesn't
16:47 <@bikcmp> oh
16:47 <@bikcmp> `: doesn't need to be static
16:47 <@`> per se
16:47 <@bikcmp> just needs to be it's own ip
16:47 <@`> it CANNOT be a shared ip
16:47 <@bikcmp> unless you use ssi
16:47 <@`> right
16:47 <@bikcmp> it can
16:47 <@bikcmp> SSI :)
16:47 <@bikcmp> lol
16:48 <@`> no
16:48 <@`> trust me
16:48 <@`> that'll break it
16:48 <@bikcmp> `: i know ;p
16:48 <@bikcmp> i have servers, d/w

19:58 <@bikcmp> coughNANO
19:58 <@alyx> lol
20:04 <@Dan> nano's problem wasn't the setup.
20:04 <@Dan> nano's problem was OVH, and not letting anyone help him, that knew how the OVH shit worked
20:06 <@`> bikcmp: so what're you doing with it right now?
20:08 <@alyx> knowing him
20:08 <@alyx> probably ban evading somewhere
20:08 <@alyx> I mean what!
20:09 <@`> oh for fucks sake, he's gone again
20:10 <@alyx> lul
20:11 <@bikcmp> :-)
20:30 <@bikcmp> ick
20:30 <@bikcmp> lo
20:30 <@bikcmp> alyx: ProtocolError: <ProtocolError for accounts.irondust.net/api: 500 Internal Server Error>
20:30 <@bikcmp> lol
20:31 <@Dan> I still dislike the move to web based shit
20:32 <@bikcmp> why?
20:32 <@bikcmp> Dan: why have just yet another irc network.
20:32 <@bikcmp> everything is the same and booooooring.
20:32 <@bikcmp> typical webchat, typical services
20:32 <@bikcmp> let's just use freenode because it's bigger.
20:33 <@Dan> yes, but you can create something different that isn't stupid.
20:33 <@bikcmp> Dan: ok
20:33 <@bikcmp> like?
20:33 <@Dan> rizon created funserv. it's prolly one of the best things they ever made.
20:33 <@bikcmp> yes
20:33 <@bikcmp> Dan: but i don't want to just host a dying old protocol.
20:34 <@Dan> this is an irc network, it will always be an irc network, if you'd like to change that, don't rebuild the wheel, move to xmpp, or some flash chat shit, because this is irc
20:34 <@bikcmp> Dan: it's a communication network.
20:35 <@bikcmp> i don't want it to be just irc.
20:35 <@Dan> make something that engages your irc users
20:35 <@bikcmp> i said that from the start.
20:35 <@bikcmp> i'd like irc to be one of the services, for sure.
20:35 <@bikcmp> i told you from the start i wanted the 'irc' team, the bleh team
20:35 <@bikcmp> etc
20:35 <@Dan> when you started irc.bikcmp.com, you were making an irc network.
20:36 <@bikcmp> and?
20:36 <@Dan> when you changed to FOSSnet, you were making a freenode clone.
20:36 <@bikcmp> ikr
20:36 <@alyx> Dan: it's not a communication network
20:36 <@alyx> it's an irc network
20:36 <@Dan> then you split from Kottnet, and you decide you don't wanna be an irc network anymore
20:36 <@bikcmp> inb4 stupid joke
20:36 <@bikcmp> Dan: so far so good
20:37 <@alyx> and now you have irondust
20:37 <@alyx> which is an irc network
20:37 <@alyx> and hwoever much you want to say otherwise
20:37 <@alyx> that won't change
20:37 <@Dan> so if you don't wanna be an irc network anymore, why did you start with IRC?
20:37 <@Dan> alyx: I agree
20:37 <@bikcmp> Dan: because i had a userbase which liked irc.
20:37 <@bikcmp> and irc was easy.
20:38 <@bikcmp> Dan: that's like asking google why they started off with a search engine
20:38 <@bikcmp> then decided they wanted to make gmail
20:38 <@bikcmp> "you're a search engine, not a email provider"
20:38 <@bikcmp> they're doing pretty darn well, i hear.
20:38 <@Dan> your userbase likes irc. they aren't gonna like a bastardized communication network. google's most popular service is still search. if they got rid of search, I bet they'd die. that's their core business, their primary concern
20:39 <@Dan> learn something from that
20:39 <@bikcmp> yes
20:39 <@bikcmp> Dan: which is why i am not eoling irc by any means
20:39 <@bikcmp> :)
20:40 <@Dan> but you're trying to make it into not irc.
20:41 <@bikcmp> Dan: i'm trying to turn to some web based services, yes
20:41 <@bikcmp> i'm definitely not eoling irc
20:41 <@bikcmp> by all means.
20:41 <@Dan> by all means create some web based community, but make it seperate from irc.
20:41 <@bikcmp> then i'll be yelled at for spamming
20:41 <@bikcmp> :-)
20:41 <@Dan> don't destroy the irc network by alienating your users
20:42 <@bikcmp> xmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: "<class 'werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound'>:404: #4: Invalid authkey.">
20:42 <@bikcmp> er
20:42 <@Dan> if you move nick and channel registration to the web, I gurantee you will hurt this network greatly.
20:43 <@bikcmp> channel registration will not move
20:43 <@bikcmp> nick registration, well
20:43 <@bikcmp> Dan: feel free to help me code something
20:43 <@Dan> the users can always move to another irc network, if you choose to do this. you need to make sure your users support what you are doing. I have a feeling they don't. ask your users what you should be working on.
20:44 <@Dan> the users are the best people to lead you in the right direction.
20:44 <@bikcmp> 21:42:20  <@Dan> the users can always move to another irc network
20:44 <@bikcmp> frankly, this network isn't popping
20:45 <@Dan> why are you scared to ask your users what they want?
20:45 <@bikcmp> i'm not!
20:46 <@bikcmp> Dan: feel free to ask them :-)
20:46 <@bikcmp> Dan: here's the problem.
20:46 <@bikcmp> Dan: most of them want email or some other web/protocol service.
20:46 <@bikcmp> that requires an auth gateway.
20:46 <@bikcmp> that's what i'm doing.
20:46 <@Dan> xmlrpc
20:46 <@bikcmp> Dan: yes
20:46 <@bikcmp> Dan: uh
20:46 <@bikcmp> reliable
20:46 <@bikcmp> lol
20:46 <@Dan> why not use xmlrpv
20:46 <@Dan> xmlrpc*
20:46 <@bikcmp> Dan: i don't want atheme to be our primary authentication database
20:47 <@Dan> why not? it's reliable.
20:47 <@bikcmp> more reliable than clusters of failsafe servers?
20:48 <@Dan> doesn't atheme support sql? can't you make an sql cluster? can't you have a backup copy of atheme on another node?
20:48 <@bikcmp> 21:46:29  <@Dan> doesn't atheme support sql?
20:48 <@bikcmp> no
20:48 <@bikcmp> only flatfiles that lag 5 minutes.
20:48 <@bikcmp> can't you have a backup copy of atheme on another node?
20:48 <@bikcmp> yes, i did that
20:48 <@bikcmp> it lagged by... 5 minutes.
20:48 <@bikcmp> huge replication lag.
20:48 <@Dan> does 5 minutes matter that much?
20:49 <@bikcmp> Dan: ...
20:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: remember rants about this?
20:49 <@bikcmp> i do.
20:49 <@Dan> alyx: why am I here again?
20:49 <@alyx> hi
20:50 <@bikcmp> alyx: remember rants about replication lag?
20:50 <@bikcmp> ... i do
20:50 <@alyx> lol
20:50 <@bikcmp> alyx: so i'm correcting it
20:50 <@Dan> bikcmp: why did you ask me to join the staff?
20:50 <@bikcmp> and now they want replication lag
20:50 <@bikcmp> Dan: because you're one of the smartest people i know :)
20:50 <@alyx> bikcmp: how are you correcting it?
20:50 <@bikcmp> alyx, uh, <.<
20:51 <@bikcmp> alyx: because i want to do a new service.
20:51 <@alyx> bikcmp: I said how
20:51 <@bikcmp> but in order to do that i need a bridging gateway for our authentication database.
20:51 <@alyx> not why
20:51 <@bikcmp> alyx: making a gateway.
20:51 <@bikcmp> a centralized authentication gateway.
20:51 <@bikcmp> and making irc.irondust.net irondust irc
20:51 <@bikcmp> and irondust, well, irondust
20:52 <@Dan> 5 minutes is not a big deal. there's rarely anything happening with services, the rare nick or channel registration.
20:52 <@bikcmp> Dan: i got lots of complaints about it.
20:52 <@bikcmp> so i'm correcting it.
20:52 <@Dan> you'd just hope that nothing would happen in that 5 minutes, and if it does, 1 pissed off user will get over it. shit happens
20:53 <@bikcmp> i'm almost done, so i'm going to use this way.
20:53 <@alyx> uhhuh
20:53 <@alyx> "almost done"
20:53 <@alyx> right
20:53 <@Dan> I don't support this way
20:53 <@alyx> :P
20:53 <@bikcmp> alyx: no, i'm literally done
20:53 <@alyx> bikcmp: stop pulling a dKingston
20:53 <@bikcmp> alyx: done as in jstoker's sex life is done
20:53 <@bikcmp> (did it even start?)
20:53 <@bikcmp> i'm plugging the permission module into it
20:53 <@alyx> (you don't want to know . . .)
20:53 <@Dan> I am against this, just letting you know.
20:54 <@Dan> alyx is against it too.
20:54 <@bikcmp> so
20:54 <@bikcmp> how would you like me to fix it?
20:54 <@bikcmp> i listened to the users about the 5 minute replication lag.
20:54 <@bikcmp> that part is gone, 0 lag.
20:54 <@bikcmp> well, seconds.
20:55 <@Dan> your users don't realize how little is happening in services generally
20:55 <@Dan> they think there is gonna be a big loss, and you didn't do anything to show them there's not.
20:55 <@bikcmp> Dan: believe me
20:55 <@Dan> you wanted a reason to do this, and that was it
20:55 <@bikcmp> i replicate this database like fuck.
20:55 <@bikcmp> this database isn't going anywhere 
20:56 <@bikcmp> >>> s.CheckAuthToken(consumer_key,consumer_secret,key,secret)
20:56 <@bikcmp> {'request': {'UID': '0C27C54ADC2011E18DEA00265E184EF4', 'ACCOUNTNAME': 'bikcmp'}, 'id': 'DC4603F8DC4411E1800600265E184EF4', 'time': 1343872425.664511}
20:56 <@bikcmp> alyx: done.
20:56 <@Dan> I don't care about that
20:56 <@bikcmp> Dan: this database should be able to scale to google sizes.
20:56 <@bikcmp> seriously.
20:56 <@bikcmp> eh
20:56 <@bikcmp> yahoo :P
20:56 <@Dan> you're not google
20:56 <@Dan> you're not yahoo
20:56 <@bikcmp> Dan: might be the next google!
20:56 <@bikcmp> ;)
20:56 <@Dan> nope.
20:56 <@bikcmp> Dan: i'm thinking big.
20:56 <@bikcmp> sorry.
20:56 <@bikcmp> Dan: so
20:57 <@bikcmp> let's get off of the subject of 'hate bikcmp'
20:57 <@alyx> lol
20:57 <@bikcmp> and get onto the subject of "how can we fix this"
20:57 <@Dan> I don't hate you.
20:57 <@bikcmp> ok, argue with bikcmp
20:57 <@Dan> I hate your stupid idea, and I gave you the fix.
20:57 <@bikcmp> Dan: what would be ideal is a way for services to talk to the api.
20:57 <@Dan> xmlrpc
20:57 <@bikcmp> no, /services/ talk to the api
20:57 <@bikcmp> not api talk to services.
20:57 <@bikcmp> on a register, make services send an api call to my database.
20:58 <@bikcmp> code that and i will happily implement it. :)
20:58 <@Dan> do it the other way around
20:58 <@bikcmp> Dan: no, i don't want to have a spof.
20:58 <@Dan> add to your db, then send it to services
20:58 <@bikcmp> "add in another backup services"
20:58 <@bikcmp> Dan: dude that's what i'm doing 
20:58 <@bikcmp> comeo n
20:58 <@bikcmp> Dan: that's exactly what i'm doing.
20:58 <@bikcmp> register on the web, it'll propgate to services.
20:59 <@bikcmp> register on irc, propgates to the web in about 5 to 10 minutes.
20:59 <@bikcmp> come on.
20:59 <@Dan> I don't see the big deal with a 5 minute delay. I mean geez, it takes that long to go into your email and confirm a forum registration
21:00 <@Dan> by the time they confirm their nick registration here via email, it'll already be done
21:00 <@bikcmp> ... sigh
21:00 <@bikcmp> Dan: again, feel free to help
21:01 <@Dan> I told you what to do.
21:01 <@bikcmp> no, to help
21:01 <@bikcmp> :)
21:01 <@bikcmp> Dan: services can't be the main auth db.
21:01 <@Dan> yes it can. you just don't want it to be
21:01 <@bikcmp> a either write services-ha or write an api
21:01 <@bikcmp> :)
21:01 <@bikcmp> or watch the show i mean
21:02 <@Dan> I'm done. do what you want. I don't give a fuck.
21:02 <@bikcmp> Dan: i don't mean to piss you off. 
21:02 <@Dan> I'm just gonna sit over here, and watch you fuck up the network
21:02 <@bikcmp> sorry if i am.
21:02 <@bikcmp> Dan: and what will you do if it works? :)
21:02 <@Dan> alyx: I have popcorn
21:03 <@Dan> bikcmp: good luck with that.
21:03 <@bikcmp> :)
21:03 <@Dan> if I have to re-register my nick, I won't.
21:04 <@bikcmp> you will not
21:04 <@Dan> good
21:04 <@bikcmp> i thought hard about this.
21:05 <@Dan> you mean someone raged at you
21:05 <@alyx> hi
21:05 <@bikcmp> Dan: actually
21:05 <@bikcmp> it was my idea
21:05 <@Dan> bikcmp: can I tell you a little story?
21:06 <@bikcmp> can you?
21:06 <@Dan> I used to oper on this network called SorceryNet. it's a fantasy roleplaying network with 2600 users
21:06 -!- Marketh [~Marketh-@staff/Marketh] has joined #staff
21:06 -!- mode/#staff [+o Marketh] by ChanServ
21:07 <@Dan> now they ran 2 pieces of software
21:07 <@Dan> an old copy of charybdis, and services. originally the custom coded sorservices, which were ts5, and then anope.
21:07 <@Dan> the way they grew their userbase was pretty simple
21:08 <@bikcmp> how?
21:08 <@bikcmp> how?AHA
21:08 <@bikcmp> aha
21:08 <@bikcmp> Dan: i figured out why this was failing
21:09 <@Dan> instead of making something completely new, they asked their users what they wanted. they helped users with anything they needed, and were happy to bend the rules a bit to make the users happy. they tweaked services a bit to make them work the best way for their users.
21:09 <@Dan> they always had just an ircd and services, but they have a lot more users than networks with all kinds of fun crap
21:09 <@bikcmp> Exception
21:09 <@bikcmp> Exception: Expected status [200, 300, 404], received 400 :
21:09 <@bikcmp> eh.
21:10 <@Dan> you gotta make your network a place users wanna be, and make sure your software works, and works in the way the users expect. the rest doesn't really matter that much
21:10 <@bikcmp> >make  sure your software works, and works in the way the users  expect.
21:10 <@bikcmp> ok
21:10 <@Dan> when someone came around to harass channels, they got banned
21:10 <@bikcmp> so
21:10 <@bikcmp> let's start off.
21:10 <@bikcmp> i want irondust to be extreme reliable.
21:10 <@bikcmp> like, crazy reliable.
21:11 <@Dan> users expect to be able to type /ns register password email and it work.
21:11 <@bikcmp> Dan: sure
21:11 <@bikcmp> Dan: it. will. work.
21:11 <@bikcmp> are you like, blind
21:11 <@bikcmp> Dan: /ns register password email will work.
21:11 <@Dan> users expect to not be banned for typing the same line 5 times in a row fast
21:12 <@bikcmp> Dan: those users deserve the ban they get
21:12 <@bikcmp> seriously
21:12 <@bikcmp> 'don't be an idiot'
21:12 <@Dan> users expect not to be forced to use a web interface for shit
21:12 <@bikcmp> you don't need to use the web interface
21:12 <@Dan> xanos failed for once
21:12 <@bikcmp> can you actually read what i say instead of just complaining?
21:12 <@bikcmp> i have the vibe you are just complaining.
21:13 <@Dan> I am complaining, because I disagree with the whole damn idea
21:13 <@bikcmp> dude
21:13 <@bikcmp> it will not change ANYTHING AT ALL.
21:13 <@bikcmp> that's like saying you don't want more money
21:13 <@Dan> you said it would like 1-2 weeks ago
21:13 <@bikcmp> Dan: yes
21:13 <@bikcmp> and then I CHANGED IT.
21:13 <@bikcmp> shocker
21:13 <@bikcmp> i changed it because i listened to fucking users.
21:13 <@Dan> because I bitched at you
21:13 <@bikcmp> no
21:13 <@bikcmp> you weren't even in the game 2 weeks ago ;p
21:14 <@bikcmp> 57:10  <@bikcmp> register on the web, it'll propgate to services.
21:14 <@bikcmp> 21:57:25  <@bikcmp> register on irc, propgates to the web in about 5 to 10  minutes.
21:14 <@Dan> I have been in the game for months
21:14 <@bikcmp> i already told you that
21:14 <@bikcmp> you just want to complain 
21:14 <@bikcmp> i'm going to go code
21:14 <@bikcmp> bye
21:14 <@Dan> if you don't like my complaining, remove me.
21:14 <@Dan> because I will continue to voice my opinion.
21:14 <@bikcmp> and i hope you do
21:14 <@Dan> you can't run away and code forever
21:15 <@bikcmp> Dan: i appreciate your feedback, seriously.
21:15 <@bikcmp> Dan: i just don't understand how i could, hm
21:15 <@bikcmp> what's the word.
21:15 <@bikcmp> meet in the middle.
21:15 <@bikcmp> you're saying do it this way or nothing.
21:16 <@Dan> I am saying to do it the way I am, because I know it's the right way.
21:16 <@bikcmp> ok, hm.
21:16 <@bikcmp> Dan: how about we do a poll.
21:16 <@Dan> I've only opered on, I don't know, 15-20 networks
21:16 <@Dan> I like polls
21:17 <@bikcmp> Dan: i'll ask users.
21:17 <@Dan> they take in other input besides ours
21:20 <@bikcmp> hm
21:20 <@bikcmp> ok
21:20 <@bikcmp> Dan: how should i do the poll.
21:20 <@bikcmp> so you can't come after me and say that i lied.
21:20 <@bikcmp> and so that users can't vote more than 1 time.
21:20 <@bikcmp> have them join #yes and #no?
21:20 <@bikcmp> actually that's a great idea.
21:21 <@bikcmp> in #yes we could talk about why we should
21:21 <@bikcmp> and in #no we can talk about why not
21:21 <@bikcmp> see what outweighs the other
21:21 <@bikcmp> ?
21:22 <@Dan> nope
21:22 <@bikcmp> Dan: ok, how.
21:22 <@Dan> here's the best way to poll just the users online atm
21:22 <@bikcmp> Dan: global?
21:22 <@bikcmp> Dan: yes, that's exactly what i was talking about
21:22 <@bikcmp> -P
21:22 <@Dan> if you are generally sitting in your most active channels,
21:22 <@bikcmp> Dan: yeah
21:22 <@bikcmp> i also did that too :)
21:22 <@Dan> just ask in all
21:23 <@bikcmp> 22:20:30  <@bikcmp> ok.
21:23 <@bikcmp> 22:20:38  -!- subcool [~subcool@eebx-144-02-527-56.pghkny.fios.verizon.net] has  quit [Remote host closed the connection]
21:23 <@bikcmp> 22:20:38  <@bikcmp> i have a question for you.
21:23 <@bikcmp> 22:20:46  <@bikcmp> i'd like to shift irondust towards web based services
21:23 <@bikcmp> 22:20:49  <@bikcmp> or other nonirc protocols.
21:23 <@bikcmp> ahead of you.
21:23 <@Dan> that wasn't a question
21:23 <@bikcmp> i'm typing.
21:23 <@Dan> add would you guys approve of this idea?
21:23 <@Dan> :)
21:24 <@bikcmp> Dan: 
21:24 <@bikcmp> 22:21:45  <@bikcmp> this requires an authentication gateway.
21:24 <@bikcmp> 22:21:58  <@bikcmp> i don't want to rely on one server (services).  that adds a  /big/ point of failure. 
21:24 <@bikcmp> 22:22:17  <@bikcmp> so, i'd like to make it so account management must be done  through a pretty nice web interface.
21:24 <@bikcmp> 22:22:41  <@bikcmp> this might reduce what you can do with your irondust  account on irc (nickserv stuff), but it won't affect  chanserv/channels in any other way.
21:24 <@bikcmp> 22:22:45  <@bikcmp> is this a good idea?
21:27 <@bikcmp> Dan: 
21:27 <@bikcmp> 22:23:39  <bikcmp> 22:22:45  <@bikcmp> is this a good idea?
21:27 <@bikcmp> 22:25:11  <AproSamurai> Ahhh.
21:27 <@bikcmp> 22:25:25  <AproSamurai> Sounds like a decent way to go if you'd like to expand.
21:27 <@bikcmp> 22:25:27  <bikcmp> the current staff are putting up a fuss about this.  i think  it's a great idea.
21:28 <@`> i still say retain the ability to entirely manage an account *in* irc
21:28 <@`> like normal
21:28 <@bikcmp> `: well
21:28 <@bikcmp> `: here's the thing.
21:28 <@`> but also have web-based.
21:28 <@bikcmp> `: i don't know how to do that.
21:29 <@`> simple.
21:29 <@bikcmp> `: if someone would help me rather than complain, they'd code it for me.
21:29 <@bikcmp> )
21:29 <@`> use anope.
21:29 <@bikcmp> :)
21:29 <@bikcmp> `: tbh i've considered it.
21:29 <@bikcmp> but... atheme is nice.
21:29 <@`> it uses databases that are documented
21:29 <@bikcmp> `: ikr
21:29 <@bikcmp> `: opensex is easy enough 
21:29 <@bikcmp> but yeah
21:29 <@`> so dont make it so difficult
21:30 <@`> use anope.
21:30 <@bikcmp> `: well
21:30 <@bikcmp> `: the database is half of the problem.
21:30 <@bikcmp> `: anope uses sql right?
21:30 <@bikcmp> tbh that'd make it much easier
21:30 <@`> yes.
21:30 <@`> anope can use either flatfile or sql
21:30 <@bikcmp> eh
21:30 <@`> really
21:31 <@bikcmp> `: 
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:28:15  <bikcmp> 22:22:45  <@bikcmp> is this a good idea?
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:28:48  <MasterBTB> sure
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:29:07  <bikcmp> do you have anything positive or negitive to say about this?
21:31 <@`> it can store its db anywhere
21:31 <@`> almost anywhere.
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:29:14  <MasterBTB> well
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:29:22  <MasterBTB> as long as my channels are kept
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:29:29  <MasterBTB> and i can get on
21:31 <@bikcmp> 22:29:43  <bikcmp> they will be and they'll be much more reliably stored
21:31 <@bikcmp> `: well
21:31 <@bikcmp> `: yeah.
21:31 <@bikcmp> basically i want atheme or services to hold the /IRC/ database.
21:31 <@bikcmp> not irondust's.
21:31 <@bikcmp> hold data that relates to irc.
21:31 <@bikcmp> not all of irondust.
21:32 <@`> basically you only want the nick.db
21:32 <@`> easy enough in anope
21:32 <@`> just use nick.db
21:32 <@bikcmp> yah
21:32  * bikcmp shrug.
21:32 <@`> seriously, man
21:32 <@`> you make things difficult.
21:32 <@bikcmp> `: i'll seriously consider it.
21:32 <@bikcmp> `: ikr :(
21:33 <@`> i use shit thats known to be modular
21:33 <@`> and well-documented
21:33 <@bikcmp> atheme is extremely modular
21:33 <@bikcmp> documented not so much
21:33 <@`> exactly.
21:34 <@bikcmp> `: well
21:34 <@bikcmp> `: i'll think about it.
21:34 <@bikcmp> seriously.
21:34 <@`> alright.
21:34 <@`> at least try to setup a test machine
21:34 <@`> with unreal/anope
21:34 <@`> and see if we can adapt our existing shit onto that
21:35 <@`> it'd be an interesting test case, if anything.
21:35 <@bikcmp> `: unreal isn't happening
21:35 <@bikcmp> sorry
21:35 <@bikcmp> unreal won't happen
21:35 <@bikcmp> anope, maybe.
21:35 <@`> aw why not
21:35 <@bikcmp> `: i hate unreal.
21:35 <@bikcmp> hate it.
21:36 <@`> why.
21:36 <@bikcmp> `: it does NOT scale.
21:36 <@bikcmp> and it's abusive.
21:36 <@`> it scales just fine for me
21:36 <@bikcmp> and i don't trust the code.
21:36 <@`> and i can lock it all the hell down
21:36 <@`> not only that, anope provides extra security upon itself
21:36 <@`> using defcon levels.
21:36 <@bikcmp> yes, we have defcon too
21:37 <@bikcmp> :P
21:37 <@bikcmp> along with services flood.
21:37 <@`> yup
21:37 <@bikcmp> `: i'm just thinking.
21:37 <@`> i have all that
21:37 <@`> unreal is powerful :]
21:37 <@`> you just have to know how to use it
21:38 <@bikcmp> `: on another note
21:38 <@bikcmp> `: nameuser and masterx want founder for #shittyepisode
21:38 <@bikcmp> one of the founders was klined, the other is away.
21:39 <@bikcmp> `: thoughts?
21:39 <@bikcmp> `: i have no proof of masterbtb or whoever being an op.
21:39 <@bikcmp> nameuser claims he was a founder, and he set the topic.
21:40 <@bikcmp> Dan?
21:40 <@`> this is why i think we should have a services bot logging everything in channels
21:40 <@bikcmp> `: hell no
21:40 <@`> so we have a neutral source of logs
21:40 <@bikcmp> `: hahahahahaha no
21:40 <@`> this is how i have it on my network
21:41 <@bikcmp> `: irondust isn't a registered entity.
21:41 <@`> neither is mine.
21:41 <@`> ._.
21:41 <@bikcmp> if any questions about privacy come up, we could be in trouble.
21:41 <@bikcmp> i say log the least we can.
21:41 <@bikcmp> i also don't like logging everything.
21:41 <@bikcmp> `: what if we get hacked?
21:41 <@`> hahahahahahahahahahaha
21:41 <@bikcmp> we're now known as being the abusive network.
21:41 <@`> what privacy?
21:41 <@bikcmp> see: mibbit
21:42 <@bikcmp> `: tbh not much on irc
21:42 <@bikcmp> but hey
21:42 <@`> are you fucking being serious
21:42 <@bikcmp> why add gasoline to the fire
21:42 <@`> any public channel
21:42 <@`> is just that
21:42 <@`> public
21:42 <@`> period.
21:42 <@bikcmp> `: i /do/ have logs of who was op.
21:42 <@bikcmp> who was the most active op.
21:42 <@bikcmp> etc.
21:42 <@`> still, though.
21:42 <@bikcmp> it's just my ethos
21:43 <@bikcmp> why log.
21:43 <@bikcmp> why waste resources.
21:43 <@bikcmp> and imo, why disrespect users' privacy
21:43 <@bikcmp> i wouldn't like it if i knew everything i said was logged 
21:43 <@`> theres *no* expectation of privacy
21:43 <@`> in any public channel
21:43 <@bikcmp> `: you said log 'everything'
21:43 <@bikcmp> i would consider pm's everything.
21:43 <@`> PMs, however would be *explictly* not logged
21:43 <@`> no
21:43 <@bikcmp> oh.
21:44 <@bikcmp> hm
21:44 <@bikcmp> that's more considerable
21:44 <@`> i consider "everything" any #chan
21:44 <@bikcmp> well
21:44 <@bikcmp> i stillith it.
21:44 <@bikcmp> disagree with
21:44 <@`> ._.
21:44 <@bikcmp> anyway
21:44 <@`> public is public
21:44 <@`> #channel
21:44 <@bikcmp> Dan: i have 3 yeses.
21:46 <@`> i just had a thought
21:46 <@`> why not just use an eggdrop bot
21:46 <@bikcmp> wait
21:46 <@bikcmp> `: why not use xanos
21:46 <@`> exactly.
21:46 <@bikcmp> `: i have xanos as read-only in some channels.
21:47 <@bikcmp> ie, learn english mode.
21:47 <@`> so use that to your advantage
21:47 <@`> have it log things
21:47 <@bikcmp> `: xanos actually already logs everything
21:47 <@bikcmp> ll
21:47 <@bikcmp> `: here's the thing though: logs are anonymized.
21:47 <@`> lol, then use that as your neutral source of logs
21:47 <@`> yeah, thats the problem
21:47 <@`> unanon them
21:47 <@bikcmp> `: and, they aren't in any order.
21:47 <@`> make them actual logs :P
21:48 <@bikcmp> it's a database of each word and what xanos thinks it means 
21:48 <@bikcmp> lol
21:48 <@`> well
21:48 <@`> make it log proper logs
21:48 <@bikcmp> `: well
21:48 <@bikcmp> `: i'm in every channel xanos is in.
21:48 <@`> and maybe make it log a standard format
21:48 <@bikcmp> and i keep logs
21:48 <@bikcmp> :)
21:48 <@`> that pisg can read
21:48 <@`> bam! stats.
21:48 <@`> :]
21:48 <@bikcmp> uh
21:48  * bikcmp shrug
21:48 <@`> http://pisg.sourceforge.net
21:49 <@bikcmp> i know what pisg is
21:49 <@bikcmp> `: i want to make 2 or 3 leaders for 'irc'.
21:49 <@bikcmp> i'd like to do the bridging stuff.
21:49 <@`> hm.
21:49 <@bikcmp> and accounts.
21:49 <@bikcmp> 127.0.0.1 - - [01/Aug/2012 22:08:40] "GET /SetSession?redir=%2FManage&secret=8ADA98744F634732A585347AC944D337&key=FA026AF6DC4611E1BD6D00265E184EF4 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
21:49 <@bikcmp> jesus
21:49 <@bikcmp> lol
21:50  * Dan looks in, then decides to continue watching anime
21:50 <@bikcmp> Dan: fwiw, you too.
21:50 <@bikcmp> 22:47:44  <@bikcmp> `: i want to make 2 or 3 leaders for 'irc'.
21:50 <@`> bikcmp: you using the VM any, at all?
21:50 <@bikcmp> `: as of right now?
21:50 <@bikcmp> no
21:50 <@bikcmp> `: i'm still working on the databse.
21:50 <@`> heh
21:50 <@`> well, it's in place and up.
21:50 <@bikcmp> `: to be entirely honest i likely won't use the vm for another 3 or 4 days.
21:50 <@`> aww.
21:51 <@bikcmp> until i work out everything with accounts.
21:51 <@`> ok then.
21:51 <@bikcmp> then i'll blast it into production and put it on 3 servers
21:51 <@`> it's just too bad i dont have static IPs
21:52 <@bikcmp> Dan: also, freenode. ;)
21:52 <@bikcmp> exactly why i don't want svs to be our db.
21:54 <@Dan> that's not a services problem.
21:54 <@Dan> that's a freenode problem. lol
21:55 <@bikcmp> so you're saying that services will NEVER die?
21:55 <@bikcmp> with my db shit is expected to happen
21:55 <@bikcmp> lol
21:55 <@`> yeah pretty much
21:55 <@`> as to utility
21:55 <@`> power, internet, etc
21:55 <@`> it's damn solid
21:56 <@bikcmp> but. shit happens.
21:56 <@`> granted.
21:56 <@bikcmp> `: "why prepare for a fire? it'll never happen"
21:56 <@bikcmp> :)
21:56 <@bikcmp> but then when it /does/ happen you're fucked.
21:56 <@`> i have UPS in place, as well
21:56 <@`> yeah, heh
21:57 <@bikcmp> so
21:57 <@bikcmp> i'm completely prepared for /worst case/.
21:59 <@bikcmp> actually
21:59 <@bikcmp> `: i think i'm going to deploy it.
21:59 <@bikcmp> `: so
21:59 <@bikcmp> `: should i give #shittyepisode to that dude?
22:02 <@`> i honestly have no idea
22:02 <@`> just go with your best judgment
22:03 <@Dan> so you're saying your shit is never gonna go down?
22:03 <@`> no i'm not saying that
22:03 <@Dan> no, not you
22:03 <@bikcmp> Dan: mine?
22:03 <@bikcmp> Dan: uh, it's a lot less likely.
22:04 <@bikcmp> since it's completely decentralized.
22:04 <@bikcmp> it's mesh.
22:05 <@bikcmp> worst case is it'll go into readonly.
22:08 <@bikcmp> hm
22:38 <@`> now i need to put a rackmount kvm switch on my wishlist
22:44 <@bikcmp> ok
22:45 <@bikcmp> `: it's now in production mode :)
22:45 <@bikcmp> productionish anyway
22:45 <@`> what is?
22:45 <@bikcmp> lol
22:45 <@bikcmp> accounts.
22:45 <@`> heh
22:45 <@bikcmp> it's on the environment it'll be on.
22:45 <@bikcmp> i'm configuring the keys now.
22:45 <@`> so vm time?
22:46 <@bikcmp> no
22:46 <@bikcmp> `: actually maybe.
22:46 <@bikcmp> see how it links.
22:46 <@`> yes, do eet
22:48 <@bikcmp> well
22:48 <@bikcmp> `: first i want to get this running seamlessly.

21:11 <@bikcmp> no idea why it's doing this
21:13 <@bikcmp> '/3
21:16 < Dan> sounds like a glitch, wouldn't worry too much, just tell those affected to re-register
21:17 < Dan> I'm that one guy who refuses to move to atheme 7
21:22 <@bikcmp> hah
21:22 <@bikcmp> Dan: eh
21:22 <@bikcmp> Dan: i regret it now :-P
21:24 < Dan> I feel I made a good choice.
21:25 < Dan> one of the things I kinda saw, was there was never really a solid feature freeze during development.
21:26 <@bikcmp> yeah
21:26 <@bikcmp> Dan: i dunno.
21:27 < Dan> or it could be due to something not related to atheme
21:28 < Dan> like a module
21:28 <@alyx> yeah
21:28 <@alyx> i'd expect it's a module
21:28 <@alyx> atheme core is pretty damn solid
21:29 < Dan> well I can't speak for 7, because the original stable release had some nice bugs
21:30 < Dan> forget what it was now, but it was not fun
21:30 < Dan> And then we have all the stuff KindOne randomly found
21:30 <@alyx> running a number of vanilla 7 networks
21:30 <@alyx> it doesn't have weird problems
21:31 <@alyx> [anymore]
21:31 < Dan> it did in 7.00
21:31 < Dan> 7.0.0
21:31 < Dan> anymore, keyword
21:31 <@alyx> precisely :P
21:34 <@bikcmp> alyx: it is vanilla
21:34 <@bikcmp> alyx: the source of atheme running here has not been touched
21:34 <@alyx> not saying it has been
21:34 <@bikcmp> oh
21:34 <@bikcmp> hm
21:35 <@alyx> just saying "I've not had this fuckoness"
21:35 <@bikcmp> fuckonness
21:35 <@bikcmp> hmm
21:35 <@bikcmp> lol
21:35 <@bikcmp> alyx: i also love windows 8
21:35 <@bikcmp> i know i know
21:35 <@bikcmp> lol

02:22 <@huru> yeah good point
02:22 <@bikcmp> huru: do you still need tin.?
02:22 <@bikcmp> it's off

02:23 <@bikcmp> so yeah
02:23 <@huru> i have lithium setup
02:23 <@huru> just a matter of linking it in

02:27 <@huru> [19:24:31] -OperServ- [Network Notice] As part of the recent acquisiton of IronDust, we will start performing upgrades and migrations soon. The first part of this will entail services going into read-only mode for services related work. Because of this, we request you update anything you need to, regarding our services, within the next 24 hours.
02:27 <@huru> [19:24:31] -OperServ- [Network Notice] After 24 hours, a notice will be sent and any changes you make regarding services will be lost after that point. We will notify you once the work is finished, which is when you can continue making changes. Thanks for understanding and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
02:27 <@huru> that sound okay?
02:27 <@huru> i was going to do it 7am tomorrow my time
02:27 <@bikcmp> oh
02:27 <@huru> and have you give me the db like
02:28 <@huru> quiet time
02:28 <@bikcmp> huru: sure, although the 24 hours are kinda confusing
02:28 <@huru> that night
02:28 <@huru> ah
02:28 <@bikcmp> huru: i'd want to do it in 24 hours after the ntice is sent
02:28 <@huru> yeah
02:28 <@bikcmp> just say that sometime in the next day services will be shutting down briefly
02:28 <@huru> ah
02:28 <@huru> yeah 
02:28 <@huru> like maybe 24hrs later
02:28 <@huru> chuck services into readonly mode
02:28 <@huru> during dead time
02:28 <@huru> then ill link them into lithium
02:29 <@huru> then link zinc into lithum
02:29 <@huru> *lithium
02:29 <@huru> well thats my idea anyways
02:29 <@huru> then all ties to your servers bar webchat and website are gone
02:33 <@bikcmp> huru: Other Address Problems. If the order is being shipped to a prison, there may be delivery restrictions associated with the items or shippers. These restrictions are determined by the penitentiary and may vary.
02:33 <@bikcmp> hahahahahaha

04:19 <@bikcmp> huru: i was about to stop actually
04:19 <@bikcmp> you're probably right
04:20 <@bikcmp> yeah
04:20 <@bikcmp> whatever
04:20 <@huru> sweet
04:20 <@huru> thanks for jumping on and fixing that
04:20 <@huru> i was pancing for a second
04:20 <@huru> *panicing
04:20 <@bikcmp> huru: i got a text message ;p
04:20 <@huru> ah
04:21 <@bikcmp> huru: don't tell anyone but when i get highlighted more than 3 times i get a text message
04:21 <@bikcmp> inb4 abuse
04:21 <@huru> ah good.
04:21 <@huru> thanks man :) i appreciate your help on that.
04:21 <@bikcmp> huru: who thawed his account though
04:21 <@bikcmp> huru: i honestly also say get rid of nightmare
04:21 <@bikcmp> she is annoying as fuck
04:21 <@bikcmp> dan would certainly agree
04:22 <@huru> mm
04:22 <@huru> bikcmp: i had intended on removing marketh anyways
04:22 <@bikcmp> no, nightmare
04:22 <@huru> he didnt even contact me today, like i told him to and he agree'd to.
04:23 <@huru> err yeah, ill keep an eye on the nightmare situation/
04:23 <@huru> is this bot malicious at all?
04:26 <@bikcmp> huru: not a clue
04:26 <@bikcmp> huru: but i think she' sdoing it for other reasons
04:26 <@bikcmp> huru: there's no reason as to why she'd want this bot in here so badly.
04:26 <@huru> yeah.
04:26 <@huru> and besides
04:26 <@huru> does xano take care of spam
04:26 <@huru> anyways?
04:26 <@bikcmp> yes.
04:27 <@bikcmp> xanos takes care of spam, even if it's not in the channel
04:27 <@bikcmp> kinda.
04:27 <@bikcmp> huru: here's how it works.
04:27 <@bikcmp> huru: like
04:27 <@huru> okay
04:27 <@bikcmp> huru: if it's in channel (you can request it from me), it monitors the messages
04:27 <@bikcmp> and compares messages to spam
04:27 <@bikcmp> m
04:28 <@bikcmp> and looks at the content of the messages.
04:28 <@huru> nice
04:28 <@bikcmp> it's easier to set off like that: for example, if a user joins and quickly spams "fuck fuck fuck fuck"
04:28 <@bikcmp> it'll likely kline in 3 or 4 lines.
04:28 <@bikcmp> whereas if xanos is /not/ in the channel, you need to work very very hrd for it to kline you
04:28 <@huru> ah
04:29 <@bikcmp> huru: and it doesn't look at the content of messages
04:29 <@bikcmp> it just says "hm, these 3 people are posting messages at a rate of 7 messages per second; looks like a botnet"
04:29 <@huru> yeah
04:29 <@bikcmp> also looks for pm flooding
04:29 <@bikcmp> never looks at the content of pm's
04:29 <@huru> i have a funny feeling shes trying to get the channel to that irondust ripoff network.
04:29 <@bikcmp> huru: i didn't think you knew about it
04:30 <@bikcmp> huru: that's what i thought she's doing
04:30 <@huru> dan informed me
04:30 <@bikcmp> :P
04:30 <@huru> theres even a terraria channel there.
04:30 <@bikcmp> huru: there is /no reason/ as to why she would want to put that bot in there so badly.
04:30 <@huru> yeah
04:30 <@huru> but is redigit on our side?
04:30 <@bikcmp> huru: it's full of people who for some reason think spitfire did the right thing
04:30 <@huru> vandrex
04:30 <@bikcmp> huru: yes
04:30 <@huru> good.
04:30 <@bikcmp> huru: i contacted him about this the second it happened
04:30 <@huru> sweet.
04:31 <@bikcmp> huru: unlike spitfire(?) and nightmare i have a way to contact him outside of irc
04:31 <@huru> oh good.
04:31 <@bikcmp> spitfire might have it
04:31 <@bikcmp> but if so he'd have contacted him /after/ i did
04:31 <@bikcmp> ie i look a fuck ton more credible
04:31 <@bikcmp> huru: but yeah. that's what i thought she was trying to do
04:32 <@huru> yeah
04:32 <@bikcmp> huru: i can't believe she's still talking to me in #terraria
04:32 <@bikcmp> lol
04:32 <@huru> lol
04:32 <@huru> but yeah, she'll eventually stop
04:32 <@huru> or leave
04:32 <@huru> if u ignore her
04:32 <@huru> no point feeding the troll
04:32 <@bikcmp> of course
04:32 <@bikcmp> i was about to stop anyway
04:33 <@huru> nah its cool.
04:33 <@bikcmp> hmm
04:33 <@huru> have u heard much from the other big channels
04:33 <@huru> since i announced the change of ownership?
04:33 <@bikcmp> i got a few pm's
04:33 <@bikcmp> and they're like
04:33 <@huru> I thought they would've queried.
04:33 <@bikcmp> that's cool
04:33 <@huru> ah.
04:34 <@huru> i told them you wanted more free time for future projects
04:34 <@huru> i figured that was the easiest way of explaining it.
04:34 <@bikcmp> that's what i planned to do actually
04:34 <@huru> yeah
04:34 <@bikcmp> huru: connectgate is starting to get near completion
04:34 <@huru> nice :)
04:34 <@bikcmp> a lot of the stuff is irondust's account system
04:35 <@huru> ah
04:35 <@bikcmp> huru: tempted to say in #terraria do you ever fucking shut up
04:35 <@bikcmp> lol
04:35 <@huru> lol
04:36 <@bikcmp> huru: or
04:36 <@huru> i dont really want to manage the channel when its not mine
04:36 <@bikcmp> huru: 'this is why i am never getting married'
04:36 <@bikcmp> in fact
04:36 <@bikcmp> lo
04:36 <@bikcmp> l
04:36 <@huru> lol really?
04:36 <@huru> i want a wife and kids later in life.
04:36 <@bikcmp> huru: i'm joking
04:36 <@bikcmp> it's a joke
04:36 <@huru> ahah

04:37 <@bikcmp> huru: basically, i don't want a wife because she'll nag

04:48 <@bikcmp> lol

04:48 <@huru> wouldn't something like that kill her

10:21 <@`> at least someone here actually uses an actual mac
10:31 <@`> huru: can you make it so my hostmask is *?
10:32 <@`> huru: i can't oper up on my VPN.
11:27 <@JStoker> hm, strange
11:30 <@`> JStoker: i recall that bikcmp set my host to certain, specific IPs
11:30 <@`> so i want it wildcarded.
11:30 <@JStoker> oh, sorry, that was unrelated to your statement there
11:31 <@JStoker> I'd suggest that wildcarding it isn't a terribly good idea...
11:32 <@`> i hop through different hosts way too much.
11:33 <@JStoker> Perhaps limit yourself to a few, and just add those addresses in, or perhaps use a bouncer?
11:33 <@`> it'd be slightly fine if he adds my VPN
11:33 <@`> otherwise, i've never had security issues with *'ing my o:line
11:34 <@JStoker> heh, you may not have, the rest of us however...
11:34 <@`> >crappy ircd
11:35 <@`> is all i'm saying.
11:35 <@JStoker> sorry, what?
11:35 <@JStoker> Crappy ircd?
11:35 <@`> yes. crappy ircd.
11:35 <@JStoker> You're blaming the ircd for the twats who take the network over via wildcarded opers?
11:35 <@JStoker> How on earth do you suggest fixing that one?
11:35 <@JStoker> (WHILE still making it useful to the oper.)
11:36 <@`> one: i run a completely different ircd, and it's a fairly-trafficked network with cunts that try to hijack o:lines
11:36 <@`> two: *all* o:lines on said network is IP wildcarded
11:36 <@`> three: not one has been hijacked due to the way the ircd handles things
11:36 <@JStoker> Which ircd do you run?
11:37 <@`> unrealircd with anope.
11:37 <@JStoker> OH GOD.
11:37 <@`> }:A
11:37 <@JStoker> You can't be seriously thinking that unrealircd is 'better' than a sane ircd?
11:37 <@`> unreal has worked better than any other ircd i've worked with.
11:38 <@`> not only that, it's WELL documented.

12:20 <@JStoker> hm
12:20 <@JStoker> Did anyone see the Xanos message about Valtteri?
12:27 <@JStoker> Hm, is anyone else about? I'm not sure if I should or shouldn't go unk:
12:28 <@JStoker> Actually, hm. OK. I will, but bikcmp needs to discuss it a bit, so I actually know what #Xanos-AUTO-M3 is, instead of just guessing (Guessing at the flood notices, which imo shouldn't be k:linable for, but)
12:31 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Perhaps make it so that if you trigger flood notices twice or something?
12:31 <@JStoker> Or, weight it so that if you trigger flood notices, and say 'penis' or whatever the badwords are...?
12:32 <@JStoker> I don't know how Xanos works, can't really say much about it ;-p
12:32 <@JStoker> (Possibly even a nondeterministic one? if random.randint(0, 3) == 0: ;-p

13:02 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Sorry for pointing them at your direction :-p
14:51 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Can we please remove the flood-kline?
14:51 <@Dan> any flood k-lines from xanos are generally safe to remove.
14:51 <@Dan> I'm tempted to k-line xanos with the reason of unjust bans
14:52 <@Dan> since it generates too many false positives
14:53 <@JStoker> Mmm... But then again, it has it's entire life, so
15:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it was not a false positive
15:06 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Proof?
15:06 <@bikcmp> sigh
15:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: second
15:06 <@JStoker> Just because there's a /crapton/ of them (or, at very least two *today*)

15:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yes.
15:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's at 2 now.
15:09 <@JStoker> OK, awesome. That should hopefully help a bit
15:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that was the 2nd time it was k:ed by xanos 
15:09 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Perhaps have xanos notice too?
15:09 <@JStoker> (Eg, on the first time 'YO BITCH, YOU IZ FLUDING, STOP IT'
15:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i've tried that
15:12 <@JStoker> Or privmsg, although that's not the best option tbh
15:15 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
15:15 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i tried that and deemed it not worth it
15:15 <@bikcmp> because most people who trigger it are doing something stupid
15:15 <@JStoker> Eh, at least then we can complain
15:15 <@bikcmp> and will continue doing so even if they get a pm
15:16 <@JStoker> Or, are bots who aren't coded well enough to realise that flooding is bad
15:22 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Eh, It would at least let us shift blame towards the user for not reading them...
15:23 <@bikcmp> hm
15:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you want to, then?
15:23 <@bikcmp> i can do that
15:24 <@JStoker> It might be an idea for a trial for a few weeks or so
15:24 <@JStoker> To be honest, I have zero idea how to completely solve the issue, bar not k: on the floodwarn

15:37 <@huru> either that or maybe

15:37 <@huru> I dunno.
15:56 <@huru> dan / JStoker / bikcmp: can you guys start being a little more strict in #help please?

15:57 <@huru> re: spamming ascii and such i'd prefer not to  see, as a #help highlight to me typical means someone wants assistance.
15:57 <@JStoker> I'd certainly prefer having ascii art and stuff in another channel though.
15:58 <@huru> yeah

16:37 <@bikcmp> no

16:38 <@bikcmp> thinking about that
16:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
16:38 <@JStoker> ejabberd > djabberd
16:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i don't like ejabbard
16:38 <@JStoker> you're wrong
16:38 <@bikcmp> ok
16:38 <@JStoker> there's no way you can not like ejabberd
16:38 <@JStoker> it's gorgeous
16:38 <@bikcmp> i hate it
16:39 <@JStoker> why?!
16:39 <@bikcmp> doesn't scale
16:49 <@JStoker> bikcmp, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
16:49 <@JStoker> bikcmp, good one
16:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ;)
16:49 <@JStoker> Sorry, but, it does :-p
16:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tbh the docs on scaling were confusing
16:50 <@bikcmp> that being serious.
16:50 <@JStoker> O_O
16:50 <@JStoker> In what way?
16:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: "ejabberd scaling"
16:50 <@bikcmp> google
16:53 <@JStoker> How do you find that confusing?
16:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i do.
16:53 <@JStoker> bikcmp, and you think you can build a sensible distributed database? O_O
16:53 <@bikcmp> yes!
16:53 <@bikcmp> ;)

16:54 <@bikcmp> true paste ^
16:54 <@bikcmp> lol
16:57 <@JStoker> bikcmp, also, rabbitmq is lovely
16:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: really/
16:57 <@bikcmp> what
16:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that messaging poll thing?
16:58 <@JStoker> the messaging queue, yes
16:59 <@bikcmp> hmm
16:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you're right.
16:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: rabbitmq is awesome.
16:59 <@JStoker> Indeed!!!
17:00 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I mean, srsly. Being able to go 'huh, this is going slow, i'll just start a few more of them', is just so useful
17:06 <@JStoker> bikcmp, or, say, if you wanted to do logging, or debugging...
17:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: kr
17:06 <@bikcmp> ik,r
17:06 <@bikcmp> ... w/e
17:07  * JStoker wonders how bad an irc server built under rmq would be
17:07 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i was thinking the same
17:07 <@bikcmp> lol
17:07 <@JStoker> Then, it'd be so trivial to write a XMPP server for it (well, the communication between the server and the irc part would be, anyway)
17:09 <@bikcmp> hmm1
17:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i like rmq
17:09 <@bikcmp> lol
17:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hm
17:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how would you do updates to a client application
17:10 <@bikcmp> like, let's say you had some irc client that a lot of people used
17:10 <@bikcmp> and you wanted to have it check for updates.
17:10 <@bikcmp> (just figuratively speaking)
17:10 <@JStoker> Depends the order of magnitude 'lot' is in
17:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: like, 5000.
17:10 <@bikcmp> enough that if all did it at the same time it'd crash your servers.
17:11 <@JStoker> It depends on the application.
17:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i had an awesome idea on how to do it.
17:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: for the app to check for updates, check like, updates.yourdomain.com
17:11 <@bikcmp> look it up
17:11 <@JStoker> If it can go keep a persistent connection to my server, that would sort it
17:11 <@JStoker> Yeah, TXT records storing the current update version.
17:11 <@bikcmp> and updates.yourdomain.com would be a cname to like, 0.0.0.1
17:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: oh?
17:11 <@JStoker> ... OH GOD WHAT THE FUCK
17:11 <@JStoker> STOP BASTARDISING DNS
17:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and like a really long ttl
17:11 <@JStoker> bikcmp, TXT is essentially 'text'
17:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yes
17:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hm. txt might work better tbh
17:12 <@bikcmp> lol
17:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but. have like, a 24 hour ttl
17:12 <@bikcmp> so not all people get it at once.
17:12 <@JStoker> So, you'd have kewlapp:0.0.42.69
17:12 <@JStoker> Hmm
17:12 <@bikcmp> neato idea?
17:12 <@bikcmp> so in 24 hours most if not all users will have theupdate
17:12 <@JStoker> But, you'll find if one of the upstream caches expires it all at once, and if that cache is used much...
17:12 <@bikcmp> hmm
17:13 <@JStoker> Ideally, I'd do it via a persistent connection, but, DNS TXT is probably a decent enough one for at least 'omg, there's an update' warnings
17:15 <@bikcmp> JStoker: maybe that /and/ another thing
17:15 <@bikcmp> like
17:15 <@bikcmp> if txtrecord > myversion: if urllib.urlopen("http://lol.com/update/%s"%(txtrecord)).read() == "True":
17:15 <@bikcmp> or something
17:15 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ik, i'm crazy
17:15 <@bikcmp> lol
17:16 <@JStoker> :-o?
17:16 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so like
17:16 <@JStoker> Haha
17:16 <@JStoker> OH
17:16 <@bikcmp> check if the server is serving it too
17:16 <@bikcmp> but don't bug the server unless dns says it's ok
17:16 <@JStoker> So, it's first resolving the txt record, finding if the version is new enough, and /then/ getting the update
17:16 <@JStoker> Huh, that's an interesting way
17:16 <@bikcmp> JStoker: :)
17:17 <@bikcmp> eah
17:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and, no
17:17 <@bikcmp> i mean as in
17:17 <@bikcmp> check if the server says it's ok to update
17:18 <@bikcmp> maybe not == "True"... maybe like, if it isn't "False" it's a link to the update
17:18 <@JStoker> hmm, rationale behind that step?
17:18 <@JStoker> I get what you're trying to do, but I don't know why
17:19 <@bikcmp> JStoker: if the server is doing too many updates, it can deny the update to the client
17:19 <@JStoker> However, it would still initiate the first http request to it...
17:19 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but the http request is less intensive than a big download
17:20 <@JStoker> Hmm
17:20 <@JStoker> Side idea. If you included two timestamps in the TXT message, one 'update before', one 'update after', and had the client chose a random time between those two...
17:21 <@bikcmp> JStoker: O.o
17:21 <@JStoker> Or, well, no
17:21 <@JStoker> It'd be more of a 'update after', and an amount of time which you should randomise
17:21 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how about have the server specify the update after
17:21 <@bikcmp> like
17:21 <@bikcmp> JStoker: have it queue you in the update.
17:22 <@JStoker> (because, if it's update before, and that date trips, it would go 'aaaaaaa')
17:22 <@JStoker> How would that work?
17:22 <@bikcmp> JStoker: have some database
17:22 <@JStoker> Or, rabbit...
17:22 <@bikcmp> and schedule a time
17:22 <@JStoker> Oh.
17:22 <@JStoker> Oh my god.
17:22 <@JStoker> Rabbit would solve this, virtually
17:22 <@bikcmp> !!!!!
17:22 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Store the 'I want an update to version XYZ, from ABC.' message in rmq
17:23 <@bikcmp> hahahahaha
17:23 <@JStoker> Have something running off that queue, offering the updates up
17:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and have rmq just queue it
17:23 <@bikcmp> woah
17:23 <@JStoker> And that solves everything, assert rabbitmq.physical_box is not worker.physical_box
17:23 <@bikcmp> hmmm
17:23 <@JStoker> And, have the client just long-poll until that's done, or websockets, or whatever
17:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so you'd tell the client with a persistant connection?
17:23 <@JStoker> yep
17:23 <@bikcmp> wouldn't a persistant conn be expensive/
17:24 <@JStoker> You'd tell them 'OK, it's fine, you're getting your update soon...'
17:24 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Debatable
17:24 <@JStoker> bikcmp, You'd not be keeping every client on as a persistent conn, so it'd not be that bad
17:24 <@JStoker> Just the ones which are queued... And you could time them out after 5m or whatever
17:26 <@bikcmp> eh
17:27 <@JStoker> And, you could go limit your accepted connections to say 500 or something, to keep it down
18:19 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what do you think about banning nightmare
18:19 <@bikcmp> she is pissing me off
18:19 <@bikcmp> huru: too
18:19 <@bikcmp> JStoker: she's hijacked 2 accounts

18:27 <@horough> "Gay Furry Porn
18:27 <@bikcmp> wtf
18:27 <@JStoker> trwtf, why spitfire lets her pour over his log folder, but
18:27 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that's what i said
18:28 <@JStoker> He is OK with that though (I have just checked)
18:28 <@bikcmp> 23:21:37  <@bikcmp> does spitfire know you're doing that?
18:28 <@bikcmp> 23:21:56  < Nightmare> He's well aware, A/A/F
18:28 <@bikcmp> lol
18:28 <@horough> he logs users?
18:28 <@horough> on his znc?
18:28 <@JStoker> I decided to actually ask him, as you know, she may or may not be telling the truth ;-p
18:28 <@JStoker> horough, he logs his chatting with others on znc

19:08 <@JStoker> alyx, Well, as long as Jabber still works, nobody cares1
19:08 <@alyx> (Read: every single box I IRC from was a RapidXen, which got moved to Enzu and therefore had IPs go missing because I didn't know them!)
19:08 <@JStoker> ... Whoops. xD
19:08 <@alyx> JStoker: AND
19:08 <@horough> alyx: is this your new legit ip?
19:08 <@horough> static?
19:08  * JStoker huh, i thought they just gave across their ip ranges
19:08 <@alyx> horough: yeah
19:09 <@horough> ok gimme 5minutes
19:09 <@JStoker> well it's not gonna be dynamic, is it...

19:09 <@alyx> horough: kk<3 ty
19:09 <@alyx> JStoker: AND
19:09 <@alyx> JStoker: the new panel
19:09 <@alyx> requires a password reset.
19:09 <@alyx> Which would be okay
19:09 <@JStoker> ... LOLOLOLOL
19:09 <@alyx> EXCEPT
19:09 <@JStoker> nobody told you?
19:09 <@alyx> JStoker: my email for the panel
19:09 <@JStoker> Oh, they only told you on irc
19:09 <@alyx> hasn't been a working email.
19:09 <@alyx> for 2 years.
19:09 <@JStoker> 'whoops'
19:09 <@JStoker> spartairc? xD
19:09 <@alyx> no
19:09 <@alyx> sporksmoo

19:09 <@JStoker> oh jesus
19:09 <@bikcmp> lol
19:10 <@JStoker> wow, when did we have spartairc.org or whatever it was?
19:10 <@bikcmp> this is sparta
19:10 <@alyx> JStoker: '10
19:10 <@JStoker> oh wow.
19:10 <@alyx> or was it '09
19:10 <@alyx> go
19:10 <@alyx> *god
19:10 <@alyx> a long time ago
19:11 <@JStoker> hmm, it's after 2007, i can say that
19:11 <@alyx> JStoker: I think late '09/early '10 sounds right
19:11 <@JStoker> and before 2012!
19:11 <@bikcmp> alyx: what's the net addy now
19:11 <@JStoker> yeah
19:11 <@JStoker> bikcmp, /dev/null
19:11 <@bikcmp> connection refused
19:11 <@alyx> TO ARINITY AND BEYOND!
19:11 <@JStoker> huh, you're not connecting to the right /dev/null then ;-(
19:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: irc.jcs.me.uk is down
19:12 <@JStoker> huh, shouldn't be
19:12 <@JStoker> oh wait, it is
19:12 <@JStoker> strange
19:12 <@JStoker> should either nxdomain, or point to another ircd
19:12 <@bikcmp> man you suck as a serveradmin
19:12 <@bikcmp> :P
19:12 <@alyx> lol
19:12 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it isn't irc.jcs.me.uk anymore anyway (or, spartairc != that, anyway)
19:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: at the least my crazy geo system works
19:12 <@bikcmp> lol
19:12 <@alyx> lol
19:13 <@JStoker> bikcmp, well, to be fair, there isn't a me-hosted public ircd anymore, so well, what'd that point to? ;-p
19:13 <@bikcmp> :P
19:13 <@JStoker> Might end up with writing a sane ircd though, and testing it on that
19:13 <@huru> alyx: try opering up dear
19:13 <@alyx> JStoker: dude
19:13 <@alyx> JStoker: just like

17:31 <@JStoker> alyx, Heh, self-run.. ;-p
17:31 <@JStoker> alyx, Hahahahahaha
17:31 <@JStoker> alyx, And two senses of open too
17:31 <@bikcmp> open as in your mother's backdoor is open
17:31 <@bikcmp> or open as in open source
17:31 <@bikcmp> wait
17:31 <@bikcmp> they're both the same.
17:31 <@alyx> bikcmp: 
17:32 <@alyx> you're confusing my mum for yours again.

17:36 <@huru> anyways i'd like to hold a staff vote on xanos
17:36 <@JStoker> .. :D
17:36 <@huru> as everyone has been pming me of mixed opinions of it
17:36 <@JStoker> Can we wait until Dan is here too? :3
17:36 <@huru> yes.
17:37 <@JStoker> huru, I think it's cool, but... a bit less sensitive would be useful. Heh.
17:37 <@bikcmp> huru: i'll pull it if you wish
17:37 <@huru> ping me when dans here
17:37 <@bikcmp> i mean, tbh, in a way i don't like it
17:37 <@huru> bikcmp: i'd rather wait till everyones here.
17:37 <@bikcmp> sure
17:37 <@huru> dan u ` jstoker and alyx
17:37 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ... And asking you for the past twoish years about reducing sensitivity...
17:37 <@huru> i like the concept about it
17:38 <@JStoker> But, the implementation is a bit... 'ooh, that might possible maybe be spam, lets get rid of it'
17:38 <@Xan0s> like I said
17:38 <@Xan0s> Xanos is the anti-spam feminist.
17:38 <@Xan0s> "THERE'S A RAPIST SOMEWHERE. THEREFORE, i SHALL STAB EVERY MAN OR MAN-LIKE WOMAN I SEE IN THE BALLS, AND WILL SAVE MYSELF FROM THE RAPISTS."
17:39 <@JStoker> xD
17:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it does what it can to avoid false akills
17:39 <@Xan0s> JStoker: yeah, what bikcmp said
17:39 <@JStoker> ... No, it doesn't.
17:39 <@Xan0s> JStoker: xanos takes EXTRA precautions
17:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yes, it does
17:39 <@JStoker> ... No, it doesn't.
17:39 <@Xan0s> JStoker: to make sure
17:39 <@Xan0s> JStoker: all of its akills
17:40 <@Xan0s> JStoker: are real akills.
17:40 <@JStoker> xD
17:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: if user connected for more than x seconds: points-=10
17:40 <@Xan0s> It will even PM operserv twice!
17:40 <@JStoker> Hahahahahahahahahaha
17:40 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Then, decrease x! Or, add more of that sorta thing!
17:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i do
17:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i have tons.
17:40 <@JStoker> Not enough!
17:40 <@Xan0s> I want funyuns
17:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: if nick in popularnames, if user.has_rdns
17:41 <@bikcmp> if notmanycapsinnick
17:41 <@bikcmp> etc
17:41 <@bikcmp> if user is talking in english
17:42 <@JStoker> Also, Pizza is yum.
17:42 <@JStoker> Well, I'll be here for a few minutes. If I'm wanted for anything, ask. If I'm not, well, don't ;-p
17:42 <@JStoker> bikcmp, For one, you can't possibly tell if they're talking in english or not, but that's aside the point.
17:42 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Decrease weightings for some things?
18:00 <@JStoker> Anyway, i'm off.

15:07 <@JStoker> Ah, k ;p
15:08 <@bikcmp> wasn't sure if it was a kline by keymaster
15:08 <@JStoker> Bah, keymaster
15:08 <@bikcmp> in which wasn't made via services
15:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'll insert a keymaster up your bum :P
15:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: sup
15:08 <@JStoker> ;o
15:08 <@JStoker> bikcmp, just updating to vmware9
15:08 <@JStoker> bikcmp, you?
15:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: someone i knew in oregon had this laptop
15:09 <@bikcmp> dell inspiron n5110
15:09 <@bikcmp> they were old but couldn't figure out how it worked
15:09 <@JStoker> not totally sure why, as i'm planning to go wipe this machine and install hyperv, but you know
15:09 <@JStoker> :o
15:09 <@bikcmp> and said that they thought it was broken
15:09 <@bikcmp> i thought it was the power cord
15:09 <@bikcmp> and so i'm like
15:09 <@bikcmp> i'll buy it, $200
15:09 <@bikcmp> and i ordered a $15 power cordo n amazon
15:09 <@bikcmp> they arrived 5 days ago 
15:09 <@JStoker> it exploded, didn't it
15:09 <@bikcmp> the power cord was broken that he shipped me.
15:09 <@JStoker> xD
15:09 <@bikcmp> i put mine in and it worked flawlessly.
15:09 <@bikcmp> i'm typing on it now.
15:09 <@bikcmp> :)
15:10 <@JStoker> ;-)
15:10 <@JStoker> wahey
15:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so now i have a really good computer!
15:10 <@bikcmp> not that shitty netbook
15:10 <@JStoker> ;O
15:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: this laptop would retail at $420 or so
15:10 <@bikcmp> i saw it on amazon for that
15:10 <@JStoker> neat
15:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: my brother recently got in may a $1000 laptop
15:10 <@bikcmp> he was down because he had some health problem so my dad bought him a killer laptop
15:11 <@bikcmp> his was an i7 extreme, mine is an i3
15:11 <@bikcmp> mine has 8 gigs of ram, his had 4
15:11 <@bikcmp> mine outdid his computer in every single test for novabench
15:11 <@bikcmp> and windows experience index.
15:11 <@JStoker> bikcmp, grep aes /proc/cpuinfo? ;p
15:11 <@JStoker> Hahahahaha
15:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: now he returned it 4 days ago
15:11 <@bikcmp> and wants an even more expensive one
15:11  * JStoker wonders, what's your experience index number? ;p
15:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 6.7
15:12 <@bikcmp> his was 5.2
15:12 <@bikcmp> lol
15:12 <@JStoker> ;o
15:12 <@bikcmp> novabench i got 1069
15:12 <@bikcmp> he got 5100
15:12 <@bikcmp> err
15:12 <@bikcmp> 510
15:12 <@JStoker> agh, can't remember how to find it out, heh
15:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: start>experience
15:12 <@bikcmp> second one down
15:12 <@bikcmp> for me
15:12 <@JStoker> ah, 5.9, because the disk is crap ;p
15:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but he doesn't get that he doesn't need top of the line
15:12 <@JStoker> xD
15:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: he claims his last laptop was defective
15:12 <@bikcmp> and i'm like
15:12 <@bikcmp> dude,
15:12 <@bikcmp> it was ok until mine outdid it
15:12 <@bikcmp> lol
15:12 <@JStoker> ;o
15:13 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm telling him to just get the same laptop i got- for that price he could get one and my dad could get one
15:13 <@bikcmp> but he wants something /slightly/ better for twice the price
15:13 <@JStoker> xD ;o
15:13 <@bikcmp> JStoker: he says he =only plays games on it
15:13 <@bikcmp> and i'm like
15:13 <@JStoker> :O
15:13 <@bikcmp> ok, what game? i've played flight simulator x, the sims 3, bus simulator
15:13 <@bikcmp> and they run at 60 fps or higher
15:13 <@JStoker> flight sim ftw :D
15:13 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
15:14 <@bikcmp> JStoker: flight sim was a bit laggy at parts
15:14 <@bikcmp> but that's an extreme game
15:14  * JStoker just has the 2004 version though
15:14 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yeah
15:14 <@bikcmp> 2004 ran fine
15:14 <@bikcmp> x didn't
15:14 <@bikcmp> JStoker: anyway. what laptop would you recommend?
15:14 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm trying to stay away from asus.
15:14 <@bikcmp> he insists he needs an i7 and all that
15:15 <@JStoker> oh, 2004 runs fine on virtually /anything/... (like, the 700mhz laptop we had ages ago? ran it perfectly fine)
15:15 <@bikcmp> in reality what would you recommend ;p
15:15 <@JStoker> bikcmp, depends what you want it for
15:16 <@bikcmp> JStoker: he wants it for gaming
15:16 <@bikcmp> he says his favorite game is team fortress 2
15:16 <@JStoker> tbh, $anything would do, heh
15:16 <@bikcmp> JStoker: eyah
15:16 <@bikcmp> he doesn't get that any decent laptop would work
15:16 <@JStoker> just go to pc world, and ask 'hi, i want a decentish laptop for gaming, please suggest something which isn't £9001'
15:16 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, we don't like doing that
15:17 <@bikcmp> one, i'm /sure/ he will impulse buy
15:17 <@bikcmp> lol
15:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i told him to ask for the win experience benchmark
15:17 <@bikcmp> he won't do it
15:17 <@JStoker> don't actually go with their suggestion, go pick the one which is the furthest away from it!
15:17 <@JStoker> lul
15:17 <@JStoker> just find it out yourself
15:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
15:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: dad won't take him to best buy or any of those stores
15:17 <@bikcmp> JStoker: one he thinks my brother would impulse buy
15:17 <@JStoker> :o
15:17 <@bikcmp> which is probably correct tbh
15:17 <@bikcmp> and two he can't be assed
15:18 <@bikcmp> :)
15:18 <@JStoker> take his money away from him, give it to me, then go
15:18 <@bikcmp> JStoker: YOU'RE FUNNY
15:18 <@bikcmp> <.<
15:18 <@JStoker> i'm being serious! ;p
15:18 <@bikcmp> oh.
15:18 <@bikcmp> JStoker: the coolest thing
15:18 <@bikcmp> i have a decent camera.
15:18 <@bikcmp> JStoker: now i can start bikcmpo.rn
15:18 <@bikcmp> i mean
15:18 <@bikcmp> uh
15:18 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but now i can actually use videophone decently ;p
15:18 <@JStoker> oh god
15:19 <@JStoker> or bikcmp.xxx?
15:19 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i should get that
15:19 <@bikcmp> if it weren't $100 a year...
15:19 <@JStoker> xD
15:19 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what's your opinion on redis?
15:19 <@bikcmp> i love it.
15:19 <@JStoker> eh
15:19 <@bikcmp> not so good?
15:20 <@JStoker> unconvinced
15:21 <@bikcmp> hmm
15:21 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i've redone accounts. on another domain
15:21 <@bikcmp> in which i intend to be a one man show ;p
15:21 <@bikcmp> JStoker: using redis as the backend.
15:22 <@JStoker> oh god
15:22 <@bikcmp> :P
15:23 <@JStoker> bikcmp, rabbitmq is lovely though
15:23 <@bikcmp> eh
15:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i don't exactly know what it's for tbh.
15:23 <@JStoker> queuing messages!
15:24 <@bikcmp> but what's the use!?
15:24 <@bikcmp> lol
15:24 <@bikcmp> JStoker: also, in before hate: i kinda like windows server for some things.
15:24 <@bikcmp> 2003 though.
15:24 <@bikcmp> 2008 sucks.
15:24 <@bikcmp> lol
15:24 <@JStoker> oh god, 2003?!
15:25 <@JStoker> that's almost 9 years old
15:25 <@bikcmp> yes
15:25 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and still supported
15:25 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's minimal.
15:25 <@bikcmp> i like that.
15:25 <@JStoker> use server core then?
15:25 <@bikcmp> server core?
15:25 <@bikcmp> mmm
15:25 <@JStoker> yes? the minimal version of winserv?
15:25 <@bikcmp> huh!
15:25 <@bikcmp> JStoker: learn something new when you talk to jstoker, every time
15:25 <@bikcmp> lol
15:26 <@bikcmp> hm
15:26 <@JStoker> geez, you get presented with a query on which one you want when you bleeding install it
15:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
15:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i kinda like the 2003 over core- like
15:26 <@bikcmp> i think the 2003 interface is less... hm
15:26 <@bikcmp> intensive
15:26 <@JStoker> ...
15:26 <@JStoker> you have to be joking me
15:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, that's a joke :P
15:26 <@JStoker> ok
15:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i still prefer 2003 over 2008 though.
15:27  * JStoker rather likes 2012 at the moment... can't wait until it's properly released though
15:27 <@bikcmp> oh?
15:27 <@bikcmp> they have 2012? 
15:27  * bikcmp :x
15:27 <@bikcmp> lol
15:27 <@JStoker> yes...
15:27 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i swear to god why don't you tell me these things
15:27 <@JStoker> i have!
15:28 <@bikcmp> wtf
15:28 <@bikcmp> JStoker: The following are the estimated minimum disk space requirements for the system partition.
15:28 <@bikcmp> Minimum: 32 GB 
15:28 <@JStoker> it's the win8-ified version of winserver, it's lovely
15:28 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it doesn't use that much, heh
15:28 <@JStoker> i wtf'd too
15:28 <@bikcmp> JStoker: Be aware that 32 GB should be considered an absolute minimum value for successful installation. The system partition will need extra space for any of the following circumstances:
15:28 <@bikcmp> lol
15:28 <@bikcmp> it says 32 is the /bare/ minimal
15:28 <@JStoker> bikcmp, but it doesn't, which is the real wtf
15:28 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how much did it use?
15:28 <@bikcmp> because like
15:28 <@bikcmp> i am not a disk genie
15:28 <@bikcmp> lol
15:28 <@JStoker> bikcmp, i'll tell you when it's finished reinstalling, heh
15:29  * bikcmp :??????????????
15:29 <@bikcmp> lol
15:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how long does it take to install?
15:29 <@JStoker> bikcmp, /me is reinstalling it due to problems w/ it ;p
15:29 <@JStoker> 21%, so goodness knows
15:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how long has it been on?
15:29 <@bikcmp> i hate it when it also doesn't install fast ;p
15:29 <@JStoker> since the start of this conversation
15:29 <@bikcmp> oh
15:29 <@bikcmp> so fas
15:29 <@bikcmp> t
15:31 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i love outlook.com and office 2013.
15:31 <@JStoker> not totally convinced on office13
15:31 <@JStoker> bit... slow
15:31 <@bikcmp> JStoker: not bad for me
15:31 <@bikcmp> although i'm on a fucking fast i3
15:31 <@bikcmp> lol
15:31 <@bikcmp> WOAH
15:32 <@bikcmp> JStoker: this iso is 6 gigs
15:32 <@bikcmp> yeah right
15:32 <@bikcmp> lol
15:32 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it's the lack of ram, and the slow disk on this
15:32 <@JStoker> bikcmp, lolwut?
15:32 <@JStoker> for what?
15:32 <@bikcmp> 2012 ;p
15:32 <@JStoker> O_O

15:32 <@bikcmp> er
15:32 <@bikcmp> 12
15:32 <@JStoker> what the heck are you trying to install?
15:32  * JStoker 's is about 3g
15:32 <@JStoker> i think, anyway
15:32 <@JStoker> yeah, 3g?
15:33 <@JStoker> bikcmp, 51% now
15:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 64 bit?
15:33 <@JStoker> bikcmp, yes?
15:33 <@bikcmp> huh
15:34 <@bikcmp> hm
15:34 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ob.

15:34 <@bikcmp> PauseCancel
15:34 <@bikcmp> ;p
15:34 <@JStoker> just can't wait until they're finished w/ it, heh
15:34 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what do you think re windows 8
15:34 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I rather like it
15:35 <@bikcmp> oh?
15:35 <@JStoker> (Prefer the servery-style gui, but..)
15:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i kinda like it...
15:35 <@bikcmp> kinda.
15:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think it's a really stupid ui for mouse users.
15:35 <@bikcmp> for tablets it's genius
15:35 <@JStoker> not massively?
15:35 <@JStoker> for touchpad users, yes
15:35 <@bikcmp> <---
15:35 <@bikcmp> :)
15:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i plan on getting the surface though
15:35 <@bikcmp> iirc they're doing it at $200
15:35 <@bikcmp> so i'm like
15:35 <@JStoker> bikcmp, if you do, want to buy two and give me one? ;p
15:35 <@bikcmp> sure
15:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
15:36 <@bikcmp> lol
15:36 <@JStoker> xD
15:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: anyway
15:36 <@JStoker> 73...
15:37 <@bikcmp> 1% here
15:37 <@JStoker> Hah, fail
15:37 <@bikcmp> JStoker: .. downloading too
15:37 <@bikcmp> lol
15:37 <@JStoker> ah;p
15:38 <@bikcmp> hmm
15:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what's your favorite operating syste
15:38 <@bikcmp> m
15:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: aside from debian.
15:38 <@JStoker> bikcmp, hmm
15:39 <@JStoker> bikcmp, good question ;p
15:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i kinda like fbsd
15:39  * bikcmp shrugs
15:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i know i hate arch
15:39 <@JStoker> possibly alpine, custom linux-based, or perhaps windows even, don't really have any preferences after that
15:40 <@JStoker> haha
15:40 <@bikcmp> alpine is cool 
15:40 <@bikcmp> but doesn't seem to have a community.
15:40 <@JStoker> eh
15:40 <@JStoker> who needs a community
15:40 <@bikcmp> eh
15:40 <@bikcmp> i wouldn't run a server off of it
15:40 <@bikcmp> i'd be wowrried of security flaws ;p
15:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: know what'd be a cool os?
15:41 <@bikcmp> something like chromeos
15:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: run every app in a sandbox.
15:41 <@JStoker> ... like, chromeos?
15:41 <@bikcmp> huh?
15:41 <@Dan> hell no
15:41 <@JStoker> chromeos isn't terrible tbh
15:41 <@Dan> google is not getting control of that
15:41 <@JStoker> wouldn't use it myself, but
15:42 <@bikcmp> no
15:42 <@bikcmp> i mean as in
15:42 <@bikcmp> i'd like an os LIKE chromeos'es security model.
15:42 <@JStoker> i can see someone like my parents quite liking it, or slightly-less techy people
15:42 <@bikcmp> run every app in a sandbox.
15:42 <@Dan> main problem with chromeos: no apache, php, or mysql app
15:42 <@bikcmp> like dalvik.
15:42 <@bikcmp> Dan: chromeos is uh
15:42 <@bikcmp> not a server os
15:42 <@bikcmp> olol
15:42 <@Dan> I know
15:42 <@JStoker> Dan, ... then go run chromiumos, and go then compile what you want?
15:42 <@bikcmp> Dan: it's more of a complete idiot os
15:42 <@JStoker> bikcmp, k, main installer over, now it's doing the daft spinny thing
15:43 <@Dan> I run apache, mysql, and php on my desktops
15:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i quuite like mac os x
15:43 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ugh, we don't want any more dalvik crap
15:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: dalvik is kinda shit... WHY DO YOU USE JAVA
15:43 <@bikcmp> lol
15:43 <@bikcmp> python :P
15:43 <@JStoker> hehehe
15:43 <@JStoker> although, linux has a sandboxy thing now, which is rather cool
15:44 <@JStoker> "Preparing *swirl...*"
15:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm about to try my first app for android
15:44 <@bikcmp> this time ojn a decent computer
15:44 <@bikcmp> netbook coiuldn't handle it
15:44 <@bikcmp> lol
15:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, server-side, possibly erlang-on-xen, which i totally want to try, but don't have a spare xen box to do it on :(
15:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, oh god.
15:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: BIKCMP GONE WILD
15:45 <@bikcmp> lol
15:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i do have a market license
15:45 <@JStoker> oh god ;o
15:47 <@JStoker> I do wish it had more detail than 'preparing' or a swirl though
15:47 <@JStoker> oh, nevermind, ignore that
15:48 <@JStoker> bikcmp, now it's at oobe, so few secs
15:48 <@bikcmp> hm
15:48 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm taking my first programming class in a month btw
15:48 <@JStoker> oh god
15:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what's worse is it's erlang.
15:49 <@JStoker> i somewhat doubt it
15:49 <@bikcmp> nah
15:49 <@bikcmp> yeah
15:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's worse than that.
15:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: java.
15:49 <@JStoker> oh god
15:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tbh in some ways i don't mind java
15:50 <@JStoker> poor you
15:50 <@bikcmp> oh shut it ;p
15:52 <@JStoker> forgot how long it takes for a windows machine to log in...
15:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: do you think internet is a basic human right?
15:53 <@JStoker> debatable
15:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: the eff (iirc... it was something) says it is
15:54 <@JStoker> it's not currently, but it possibly should be
15:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think it should be
15:54 <@bikcmp> well
15:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's kinda like books.
15:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i understand both viewpoints.
15:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's a gateway to information. if you're denied it, you're denied information.
15:55 <@JStoker> mmm
15:55 <@JStoker> it does help remove censorship... but, then you have idiots with great firewalls...
15:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but by the same token, that's like saying chocolate is a basic human right too
15:55 <@bikcmp> lol
15:55 <@JStoker> heck yeah
15:55 <@JStoker> you mean to say it isn't?!?!!
15:55 <@bikcmp> uh
15:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: let me let you down easy. no.
15:56 <@bikcmp> :(
15:56 <@JStoker> :O
15:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i say it should be though (the internet
15:56 <@bikcmp> )
15:56 <@bikcmp> i know the UN might recognise it.
15:56 <@JStoker> and chocolate...
15:56 <@bikcmp> no.'
15:56 <@JStoker> they don't at the moment, so
15:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: sorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry :(
15:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i've heard talks about people trying to get them to
15:56 <@bikcmp> i do agree with that.
15:56 <@JStoker> they really should, chocolate is just brilliant
15:56 <@bikcmp> no it isn't
15:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i don't like chocolate tbh
15:56 <@bikcmp> always gives me headaches.
15:56 <@JStoker> gtfo
15:57 <@JStoker> :O
15:57 <@JStoker> bah
15:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i love red wine though
15:57 <@bikcmp> <.<
15:57 <@JStoker> ;-)
15:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: appearently red wine has some serious health /benefits/
15:57 <@bikcmp> and coffee
15:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: my general view is like
15:57 <@JStoker> 'just do what you want'
15:57 <@bikcmp> in moderation almost everything is good ;p
15:57 <@JStoker> 8.92G
15:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: still tbh kinda big.
15:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, cyanide? :p
15:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, that's the noncore version
15:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: almost
15:58 <@bikcmp> ALMOST.
15:58 <@bikcmp> lol
15:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: only exceptions imo are tabacco and poisons ;p
15:58 <@bikcmp> which are the same thing tbh
15:58 <@JStoker> actually, strictly speaking, if you have a low enough amount often enough, in theory you should be fineish
15:58 <@JStoker> yeah
15:58 <@bikcmp> because sure
15:59 <@bikcmp> you could start low 
15:59 <@JStoker> bikcmp, lets hope vmware tools install properly this time
15:59 <@bikcmp> but then you NEED more ;p
15:59 <@bikcmp> all mental.
15:59 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ... cyanide?
15:59 <@bikcmp> no.
15:59 <@bikcmp> tabacco/cigs
15:59 <@bikcmp> lol
15:59 <@JStoker> OH, are we talking about the tobacco/poisons? k
15:59 <@bikcmp> yeah ;p
15:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: found a copy of ws2003
16:00 <@JStoker> oh god
16:00 <@JStoker> wait, ws?
16:00 <@bikcmp> microsoft evaluation i think
16:00 <@bikcmp> windows server
16:00 <@JStoker> oh
16:00 <@JStoker> dreamspark? ;p
16:00 <@bikcmp> yes
16:00 <@bikcmp> lol
16:00 <@JStoker> it does seem to be more responsive under vmware 9...
16:01 <@JStoker> bikcmp, nope, i think they're 'real' versions, just under non-commercial-only licencing
16:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how much is vmware 9/
16:02 <@JStoker> nfc
16:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: did you buy it?
16:02 <@bikcmp> lol
16:02 <@bikcmp> you are a pirate!
16:02 <@JStoker> i think it's ~51 or so for the update
16:02 <@JStoker> bikcmp, No, at the moment it's under trial
16:02 <@bikcmp> hm
16:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think my cpu has virtualization support
16:03 <@JStoker> it should do
16:03 <@bikcmp> JStoker: $249
16:03 <@bikcmp> lol
16:03 <@JStoker> cool
16:04 <@JStoker> bikcmp, cross your fingers
16:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: bittorrent is awesome.
16:05 <@bikcmp> downloading eclipse from bittorrent.
16:05 <@JStoker> it's neatish
16:05 <@bikcmp> 3 mbps.
16:05 <@JStoker> hehe, yes
16:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: whereas the http mirror was giving me 200 kbps
16:05 <@bikcmp> lol
16:05 <@JStoker> :p
16:06 <@JStoker> hmm
16:06 <@JStoker> bikcmp, yep, if you're planning to virtualise win8/win12, use vmware 9 over vmware 8. MUCH better
16:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i might switch to att
16:06 <@JStoker> oh god
16:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
16:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i have this att windows phone
16:06 <@JStoker> it's like.. ACTUALLY RESPONSIVE
16:07 <@bikcmp> it's unlocked and works on tmobile.
16:07 <@bikcmp> but.
16:07 <@bikcmp> edge only.
16:07 <@bikcmp> lol
16:07 <@bikcmp> so it's slow as shit.
16:07 <@bikcmp> appearently it down't support the bands
16:07 <@JStoker> lolololololololol
16:07 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so yeah
16:07 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm paying $30 a month to tmobile
16:07 <@bikcmp> unlimited /everything/
16:07 <@bikcmp> well
16:07 <@JStoker> :o
16:07 <@bikcmp> except for talk
16:07 <@bikcmp> in which case i don't talk
16:07 <@bikcmp> lol
16:08  * bikcmp always sexts
16:08 <@JStoker> ;-)
16:09  * JStoker does rather like the metro-style start menu
16:11 <@JStoker> it also allows "reboot automatically, idgaf about uptime" too
23:26 -!- Dan [~Daniel@08-3-086-037.lightspeed.clmasc.sbcglobal.net] has quit [Quit: Rejoice, for I am gone!]
23:54 <@bikcmp> hmm
23:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what is your opinion of dogo
23:54 <@bikcmp> dojo
--- Day changed Sun Aug 26 2012
01:26 <@huru> oh man getting back into routine at work sucks :<
01:26 <@huru> sore thighs and feet
10:02 <@JStoker> Xanos didn't report that ban, did it
10:02 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Can you make sure it reports bans here too? :)
10:03 <@JStoker> [15:24:43] <@OperServ> Xanos AKILL:ADD: *@187-15-60-238.user.veloxzone.com.br (reason: (#Xanos-AUTO-M3) Doggy[~Doggy@187-15-60-238.user.veloxzone.com.br] has been automatically identified as a spambot.  Please email kline@irondust.net if this ban was placed in error.  Thank you!) (duration: 5 days, 18:20:00)
10:03 <@JStoker> Wasn't, as far as I can tell
10:04 <@JStoker> also, really weird kline time...
14:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: sure
14:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and, that ban shouldn't be removed
14:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 
14:11 <@bikcmp> 14:24:42  < Doggy> start saying he's the spybots
14:11 <@bikcmp> 14:24:42  < Doggy> lol
14:11 <@bikcmp> 14:24:43  < Doggy> lol
14:11 <@bikcmp> 14:24:43  < Quill> lol
14:11 <@bikcmp> 14:24:43  < Doggy> lol
14:11 <@bikcmp> 14:24:44  < Quill> lol
14:11 <@bikcmp> it was copying everything everyone said.
14:11 <@bikcmp> i've told them not to do that before.
14:11 <@bikcmp> like, the past 4 times he's gotten klined.
17:30 <@JStoker> bikcmp, OK. Please make sure xanos reports it here, so we are aware of them
17:31 <@JStoker> bikcmp, fair enough, i'm sick of doggy too ;p
17:31 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Just... We do like to know if something actually happens w/ xanos ;p
17:37 <@bikcmp> ;P
17:37 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm having some problems with my putty
17:37 <@bikcmp> so
17:37 <@JStoker> WAHEY
17:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i was laughing my ass off in #freenode
17:39 <@JStoker> ;-)
17:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: this idiot was like, i can't verify my email
17:39 <@bikcmp> and he's pasting his email and password in the channel
17:40 <@bikcmp> it was his nickname plus 123.
17:40 <@bikcmp> lol
17:40 <@JStoker> oh wow
17:40 <@JStoker> that's a secure password
17:40 <@bikcmp> yeah
17:40  * JStoker changes his
17:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: then i was like, change it, and no
17:40 <@bikcmp> aiden321 isn't any more secure.
17:40 <@bikcmp> lol
17:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: makes my passwords look like mad
17:40 <@bikcmp> lol
17:40 <@JStoker> oh god
17:40 <@JStoker> you still use 'letmein' don't you
17:40 <@bikcmp> no
17:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: "jstoker<3<3<3" if you must know.
17:41 <@JStoker> bikcmp, xD
17:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and on google, "1WantTo<3UJames"
17:41 <@bikcmp> lol
17:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what i actually do is think up 8 different words/
17:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: like, Horse, Black, Coffee, Sugar
17:42 <@bikcmp> i use them as my password ;p
17:42  * JStoker coughs, the last three are technically related, but anyway
17:42 <@JStoker> bikcmp, HAH, DICTIONARYATTACK :D
17:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: eh
17:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it'd take a significant amount of time.
17:43 <@JStoker> ;p
17:43 <@bikcmp> 10k words?
17:43 <@bikcmp> then capitalization
17:43 <@bikcmp> order
17:43 <@bikcmp> etc
17:44 <@JStoker> heh, at least you use a differing password
17:44 <@JStoker> and a differing password that less than 50 people know
17:44 <@bikcmp> what.
17:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: less than 50 people know?
17:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: for some of my important stuff i use some crazy passwords and totp
17:44 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ... i'd hope so
17:45 <@JStoker> (more stuff needs either openid, or some form of delegate-able protocol support) srsly
17:45 <@bikcmp> eh
17:45 <@bikcmp> i hate openid.
17:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and i hate sso
17:45 <@bikcmp> in general.
17:46 <@JStoker> bikcmp, i don't particularly care how, but if you aren't protecting your users properly, LET THEM DO IT
17:46 <@JStoker> bikcmp, why do you dislike sso?
17:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
17:46 <@JStoker> is it the 'auth once, you're done' thing?
17:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that.
17:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: kinda.
17:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: someone hacks your one account, you're fucked.
17:47 <@JStoker> that particular thing can be eliminated ;p
17:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: or, if that provider fucks up, you're fucked
17:47 <@JStoker> bikcmp, well, no, they'd have to know about where your sso is coming from, and then break into them
17:47 <@bikcmp> one, you rely on one authentication gateway- if it goes down
17:47 <@bikcmp> like
17:47 <@bikcmp> you're fucked, too
17:47 <@JStoker> bikcmp, openid supports multiple providers
17:50 <@JStoker> Do somewhat wish someone'd write an erlang openid provider though, heh
17:51 <@bikcmp> JStoker: openid providers are confusing
17:51 <@bikcmp> imo
17:52 <@bikcmp> inb4 HOW
17:52 <@JStoker> bikcmp, to implement, yep
17:52 <@JStoker> bikcmp, which is why i'm wanting someone else to write one for me ;p
17:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: awwwwwww
17:53 <@JStoker> probably will have to go end up writing my own though, which is rather annoying, but you know
17:53 <@JStoker> enough bloody clients for openid out there... heh.
17:54 <@JStoker> wonder if oauth is any better
17:55 <@JStoker> bikcmp, opinion on oath?
17:55 <@bikcmp> oath?
17:55 <@bikcmp> oh
17:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: never used.
17:55 <@JStoker> k ;p
17:59 <@JStoker> there's a few in python though, hmm
18:18 <@bikcmp> hm
18:20 <@JStoker> mh
18:21 <@bikcmp> mh
18:21 <@JStoker> hm
18:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what do you think about microwaves
18:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: safe?
18:23 <@bikcmp> not safe?
18:24 <@JStoker> Somewhat useful? Good for communication?
18:24 <@bikcmp> huh
18:24 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, microwave ovens.
18:24 <@bikcmp> lol
18:24 <@JStoker> I don't really have an opinion, they're just like the other pieces of the EM spectrum>?
18:24 <@JStoker> OH
18:24 <@JStoker> bikcmp, uh, yes, they're safe
18:25 <@bikcmp> JStoker: would you press your face against it?
18:25 <@bikcmp> :p
18:25 <@JStoker> Not particularly, but it wouldn't harm me if I did
18:25 <@bikcmp> why>
18:25 <@bikcmp> or why not
18:26 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ... because well, i can see my food cooking easily enough without it...? Not to mention, WHY would I want to?!
18:26 <@JStoker> bikcmp, and, you know that shiny grill-like thing in the window?
18:26 <@bikcmp> huh
18:26 <@bikcmp> no
18:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i mean as in why are they safe/harmful
18:27 <@JStoker> bikcmp, They're safe because of that grill-like thing. Microwaves can't pass through it.
18:27 <@JStoker> (And a few other things, but you know)
18:28 <@JStoker> bikcmp, CROSS YOUR FINGERS
18:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: uh
18:29 <@bikcmp> why
18:30 <@JStoker> bikcmp, 'bout to go restart my ssld!
18:30 <@bikcmp> i hope it crashes
18:30 <@bikcmp> i mean 
18:30 <@bikcmp> uh
18:30 <@bikcmp> <.<
18:30 <@JStoker> (got sick of debian's version, and updating to a slightly less ANCIENT version)
18:30 <@JStoker> ((also, advantage: less exploits for it :/)
18:36 <@bikcmp> http://internetessentials.com/default.aspx?dfaid=2199899&cmp=0
18:36 <@bikcmp> hmm
18:36 <@bikcmp> interesting
18:37 <@bikcmp> they offer internet for $10 a month
18:37 <@bikcmp> lol
18:37 <@JStoker> oh wow, the new chrome is nom
18:38 <@bikcmp> JStoker: eh? new chrome?
18:38 <@JStoker> like, the 'lock' bit, when you click it, gives you a load more info and stuff
18:38  * JStoker likes it
18:38 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it's an update, not sure if it's in stable yet, but it's /nice/
18:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hm
18:39 <@bikcmp> how do you fix dev channels
18:39 <@bikcmp> er
18:39 <@JStoker> fix as in
18:39 <@bikcmp> not like that
18:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: like
18:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: isn't there "channels" you can be in for chorme
18:39 <@bikcmp> dev, beta, stable
18:39 <@JStoker> now, this /should/ allow me to do SNI...
18:39 <@JStoker> bikcmp, yeah, /me is in dev ;p
18:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how do you switch?
18:39 <@bikcmp> :P
18:39 <@JStoker> although, atm running canary, as dev crashed on me a little bit ago
18:39 <@JStoker> http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
18:40 <@bikcmp> that was fast.
18:40 <@bikcmp> lol
18:40 <@JStoker> ;p
18:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what's the difference between canary/stable
18:40 <@bikcmp> also, with that
18:40 <@JStoker> everything.
18:40 <@bikcmp> eat
18:40 <@bikcmp> :)
18:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what is it
18:40 <@bikcmp> ;p
18:40 <@JStoker> bikcmp, canary is just a dev-dev version of chrome
18:41 <@JStoker> (not really recommended though, heh)
18:41 <@JStoker> hmm
18:41 <@JStoker> there is certainly a crash bug in the current dev though
18:43 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it makes cookies more prominent! :D
18:43 <@JStoker> *THAT'S* what we should have, not that stupid cookie law bullshit
18:46 <@JStoker> oh bugger, gotta update openssl too
19:15 <@bikcmp> 23:43:18  <@JStoker> bikcmp, it makes cookies more prominent! :D
19:15 <@bikcmp> what does
19:15 <@JStoker> new chrome!
19:15 <@bikcmp> ooh
19:15 <@bikcmp> Xanos: 2DE1QAZ

19:16 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hmm.
19:16 <@JStoker> guess i'll have to go compile ossl myself too, heh

19:23 <@JStoker> no ;p
19:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: order some from amazon ffs
19:23 <@bikcmp> you could get them for like $1
19:23 <@bikcmp> lol
19:23 <@JStoker> with what money?
19:23 <@bikcmp> you don't have a dollar?
19:23 <@bikcmp> i'm sure you spend more money than that on your coffee
19:23 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I do. However, I don't have any way to convert physical cash -> something useful ;p
19:23 <@bikcmp> :p
19:23 <@bikcmp> JStoker: open a bank account?
19:24 <@bikcmp> buy a prepaid debit card?
19:24 <@JStoker> bikcmp, With what proof of identity?
19:24 <@bikcmp> uh
19:24 <@bikcmp> your birth cert?
19:24 <@bikcmp> lol
19:24 <@bikcmp> assuming that it's the same type of deal in the uk
19:24 <@bikcmp> usually it's social security # and birth cert
19:24 <@bikcmp> (yes, i know you don't have ssn)
19:24 <@JStoker> not to mention, I'd have to get to a bank... how?
19:24 <@bikcmp> uh
19:24 <@bikcmp> walk?
19:24 <@bikcmp> public transport
19:24 <@JStoker> ... no ;p
19:24 <@bikcmp> lol
19:25 <@JStoker> bikcmp, not until i'm at uni, and actually have a bleddy bus pass
19:25 <@bikcmp> you can't just buy a ticket/!
19:25 <@bikcmp> you helpless thing!
19:25 <@bikcmp> :P
19:25 <@JStoker> bikcmp, yes, however that is much more than the cost of the earphones
19:25 <@bikcmp> yes
19:25 <@bikcmp> but it'll help you later on
19:26 <@JStoker> not to mention, they'll bitch the hell out of me, as i only have notes, heh
19:26 <@JStoker> and they'd reject me paying with pennies
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm so happy i'm going to be "declared" no longer a minor in a month
19:26 <@JStoker> lolol
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tbh though
19:26 <@JStoker> bikcmp, declared?
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yeah
19:26 <@bikcmp> JStoker: emmancipation or however you spell it
19:27 <@JStoker> :o!
19:27 <@bikcmp> legally an adult.
19:27 <@JStoker> that's... not good
19:27 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it'll take effect in the middle of october 
19:27 <@bikcmp> first thing i'm doing: opening a sane bank account.
19:27 <@bikcmp> i'm "not old enough" to have a bank account i can manage myself.
19:27 <@JStoker> hehe
19:27 <@bikcmp> my incompetant parents need to 'manage' it for me
19:27 <@JStoker> yes, get a bank account
19:27 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i have them, just
19:28 <@JStoker> ideally one under your control (my problem :|)
19:28 <@bikcmp> i can't use them because they're joints
19:28 <@bikcmp> aka, "can you loan me $30? thanks, knew you could"
19:28 <@JStoker> hehe
19:28 <@bikcmp> around the middle of oct i'm changing it into a checking account and removing the joint
19:28  * JStoker gets that too... which makes zero sense, since they're the ones bloody working, but you know
19:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i have more money than my parents
19:29 <@bikcmp> they don't know that
19:29 <@bikcmp> my parents leech off of my grandfather
19:29 <@bikcmp> they have like, no money
19:29 <@bikcmp> none
19:29 <@bikcmp> lol
19:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: mom spends $100 on her silly cigs every 4 days
19:29 <@JStoker> BLOODY HELL
19:30 <@bikcmp> so she "loans" money out from me
19:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: she bought like, 10 today
19:30 <@bikcmp> packs
19:30  * JStoker just double-checks that the dollar hasn't decreased rapidly
19:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm sure it has
19:30 <@bikcmp> lol
19:30 <@JStoker> O_O not enough to make that alright though
19:30 <@JStoker> £63? O_O
19:30 <@bikcmp> yeah
19:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: $10.63 each
19:30 <@bikcmp> buy something that eventually kills it's users
19:30 <@bikcmp> nice
19:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: she says she's trying to "cut down"
19:31 <@bikcmp> and i'm like
19:31 <@JStoker> bullshit!
19:31 <@bikcmp> if you want to cut down, the last thing you want to do is have them more accessable
19:31 <@bikcmp> and easy to get to
19:31 <@JStoker> ikr
19:31 <@bikcmp> make it so you need to be bothered to get it
19:31 <@bikcmp> to the point where the urge to smoke will die down
19:31 <@bikcmp> JStoker: she doesn't get that the more she smokes the more hooked she gets :p
19:31  * JStoker this time, i'm going to record what i did, so that i can actually /do this again/ when a ossl update or something happens
19:31 <@JStoker> indeed
19:32 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so yeah.  i've pretty much come to the conclusion that she isn't going to stop until she's either dead or has some very very heavy medical complications
19:32 <@bikcmp> in which case she's already fucked and smoking / not smoking can't help her

19:32 <@JStoker>  # yaaaaaaaaaay
19:32 <@JStoker> bikcmp, D:
19:32 <@bikcmp> JStoker: she's already got some warning signs
19:32 <@JStoker> :(
19:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: diabeties(sp?) 2, coughs a ton, hard to breathe, etc
19:33 <@bikcmp> so yeah
19:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: based on my guess (her mom died at 58 from lung cancer, diagnosed at 57)
19:33 <@JStoker> ugh
19:33 <@bikcmp> she has about 4 years before she gets lung cancer
19:33 <@bikcmp> and 5 to live
19:33 <@JStoker> oh fun
19:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: also one of the reasons i'm going to get enancipated, fwi
19:33 <@bikcmp> w
19:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i was able to prove my parents are incompetant.
19:33 <@JStoker> that's... not good
19:33 <@bikcmp> man, long words
19:34 <@JStoker> ok, bad at english != incompetent...
19:34 <@JStoker> just... silly
19:34 <@bikcmp> no.
19:34 <@bikcmp> JStoker: as in, my dad needs my mom to take care of him
19:34 <@JStoker> eek.
19:34 <@bikcmp> and my mom's health is getting much worse because of her own ignorance
19:34 <@bikcmp> aka, my parents are not capable of taking care of themselves
19:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so what i'm doing is going to have the option of living with an uncle, and be legally an adult
19:35 <@JStoker> as long as you've got someone who knows what they're getting into ;p
19:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: someone who has more money than their own parents?
19:35 <@bikcmp> :p
19:35 <@JStoker> well, no, more sense?
19:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: one thing i'm worried about:  who would accept a contract from someone $x years old
19:36 <@bikcmp> even if they're legally an adult
19:36 <@bikcmp> so :p
19:36 <@bikcmp> yeah
19:36 <@JStoker> there's some way around that, involving $person-over-18-who-trusts-you-know-what-your-doing, can't recall it at the moment
19:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: cosign, yeah
19:37 <@JStoker> that's the one
19:37 <@bikcmp> not over 18, btw
19:37 <@bikcmp> an adult
19:37 <@JStoker> ah
19:37 <@JStoker> oh well, in that case, you'd be fine
19:37 <@bikcmp> the law is "adult"
19:37 <@bikcmp> well
19:37 <@bikcmp> even where it says 18
19:37 <@bikcmp> JStoker: basically as of october i'm 'legally' 18
19:37 <@bikcmp> my legal age would be 18 until i turn 18
19:38 <@bikcmp> then my legal age = my real age
19:39 <@bikcmp> hmm.
19:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: OOH
19:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'll be actually able to get paid too!
19:39 <@JStoker> :D
19:39 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i do work for someone on the internet
19:39 <@JStoker> that's always a good one though ;p
19:41 <@bikcmp> yah
19:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: now he'll be able to send checks or something
19:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i don't earn much at all
19:42 <@bikcmp> though
19:42 <@JStoker> aww
19:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i make $8.90 an hour about
19:42 <@bikcmp> which is pretty good
19:42 <@bikcmp> but i work about a half hour a day
19:42 <@bikcmp> :p
19:42 <@JStoker> bugger, lost my client cert
19:42 <@JStoker> ahhh
19:58 <@JStoker> ugh, firefox's ui has changed
19:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: firefox is lol.
19:59 <@JStoker> have to use it to get a client ssl cert installed, unfortunately
20:01 <@JStoker> (only reason i have it installed... chrome doesn't support actually /getting/ the damn cert
20:02 <@JStoker> doesn't even give you the cert to install yourself, it just gets rid of it
20:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
20:02 <@JStoker> i mean, if it didn't just throw it away, i'd be fine
20:03 <@JStoker> by now i've forgotten what i wanted the cert for... heh
20:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: NOT UNUSUAL
20:04 <@bikcmp> :p
20:04  * JStoker has remembered now ;p
20:05 <@JStoker> (SNI)
20:05 <@bikcmp> sni!
20:06 <@JStoker> indeed!
20:07 <@bikcmp> hmm
20:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: should i install the windows 7 phone dev kti
20:08 <@JStoker> if you want to dev a windows phone 7, yes.
20:08 <@JStoker> if you don't, no
20:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm afraid of a fuck load of bloat.
20:08 <@JStoker> it is a tad, but
20:08 <@JStoker> eh
20:08 <@JStoker> you have VS on, so that's the majority of the bloat
20:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no i don't
20:10 <@bikcmp> oh
20:10 <@bikcmp> i would :p
20:10 <@JStoker> then it'll be pretty useless?
20:10 <@bikcmp> lol

20:37 <@bikcmp> i mean like

20:38 <@alyx> lol
20:38 <@bikcmp> alyx: is sigyn up to it
20:38 <@bikcmp> good
20:38 <@bikcmp> :p
20:39 <@alyx> perchance :P
20:39 <@bikcmp> alyx: i might want to write some ts6 protocol

22:04 <@bikcmp> alyx: how do i compile with debugging symbols
22:04 <@alyx> uh
22:04 <@alyx> compile w/ -g
22:04 <@bikcmp> alyx: how would i do that though
22:04 <@bikcmp> it's charybdis.
22:04 <@bikcmp> --enable-warnings?
22:05 <@bikcmp> make -g
22:05 <@alyx> no
22:05 <@alyx> gcc -g
22:05 <@alyx> lol
22:05 <@bikcmp> alyx: eh?
22:05 <@bikcmp> alyx: but how would i do that with charybdis? :p
22:05 <@bikcmp> just recompile ircd?
22:06 <@alyx> yes.
22:06 <@bikcmp> cflags?
22:06 <@alyx> -g
22:06 <@bikcmp> so
22:06 <@bikcmp> alyx: ./configure --CFLAGS -g
22:06 <@bikcmp> eyyes? :p
22:07 <@alyx> no
22:07 <@alyx> you're a dumbass <3
22:07 <@bikcmp> alyx: ikr.
22:07 <@bikcmp> alyx: i'm not as bad as joey (tm)
22:07 <@alyx> lol
22:07 <@alyx> true
22:08 <@bikcmp> alyx: seriously though.  i don't know how to compile it with gcc -g.
22:08 <@bikcmp> isn't that just handled by the makefile?
22:08 <@alyx> CFLAGS="-g" ./configure
22:08 <@bikcmp> ./configure --CFLAGS="-g"?
22:09 <@bikcmp> alyx: (i know, i knew what to do a few mins ago :P)
22:09 <@bikcmp> alyx: sec
22:09 <@alyx> lol
22:09 <@bikcmp> alyx: it's been done, i was fucking with you
22:09 <@bikcmp> i was about to ask what -g meant and then i figured fuck that i want this fixed
22:09 <@bikcmp> alyx: should I make clean first?
22:09 <@bikcmp> does it matter?
22:09 <@bikcmp> lol
22:09 <@alyx> i'd say do it
22:10 <@bikcmp> doing
22:11 <@bikcmp> alyx: Installing into: /home/connectgate/chary/ircd
22:11 <@bikcmp> IPv6 support ................... yes
22:11 <@bikcmp> Assert debugging ............... no
22:11 <@bikcmp> assert debugging ... no?
22:11 <@bikcmp> anyway
22:13 <@Dan> bikcmp: did you say you're making another irc network?
22:13 <@bikcmp> Dan: kinda.
22:13 <@bikcmp> Dan: it isn't irc.
22:13 <@bikcmp> Dan: it's charybdis plus a ton of rfc violations.
22:14 <@bikcmp> but first i need charybdis to COMPILE.
22:14 <@bikcmp> lol
22:14 <@bikcmp> Dan: basically i'm just copying some MSNd shit
22:14 <@bikcmp> and making irc_redir in chary
22:15 <@bikcmp> Dan: tbh i'm considering just doing my own protocol
22:15 <@bikcmp> lol
22:16 <@Dan> great
22:17 <@bikcmp> Dan: fwiw, no
22:17 <@bikcmp> i don't have any intentions on competing with id
22:17 <@bikcmp> before you ask.
22:18 <@bikcmp> alyx: fuck this
22:18 <@bikcmp> :P
22:24 <@bikcmp> j/5
22:26 <@Dan> so it's basically gonna be like a web only, or custom client only system, instead of an IRC compatible system, you're just using IRC as a starting base, but will prolly bastardize it beyond recognition as IRC
22:27 <@Dan> sounds like fun
22:38 <@JStoker> bikcmp, 'd probably highly suggest taking a look at xmpp ;p
22:41 <@JStoker> (and obviously msn)
22:57 <@JStoker> bikcmp, 98% sure i was using --with-custom-branding for one of my systems, and it worked for me
23:54 <@bikcmp> Dan: 
23:54 <@bikcmp> 03:26:44  <@Dan> so it's basically gonna be like a web only, or custom client
23:54 <@bikcmp>                  only system, instead of an IRC compatible system, you're just
23:54 <@bikcmp>                  using IRC as a starting base, but will prolly bastardize it
23:54 <@bikcmp>                  beyond recognition as IRC
23:54 <@bikcmp> ick.
23:54 <@bikcmp> Dan: yes. :P
23:54 <@bikcmp> Dan: i'm using irc as the backend.
23:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you used it with fossnet.
23:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: would you like to try again?
23:54 <@bikcmp> try with git master.
23:54 <@JStoker> bikcmp, no, i didn't with fossnet
23:55 <@bikcmp> i've gotten segfaults.
23:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: oh?
23:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you modified it to say charybdis+fossnet
23:55 <@bikcmp> changed packageinfo?
23:55 <@JStoker> bikcmp, that was actually modifying it ;p
23:55 <@bikcmp> ah
23:55 <@bikcmp> :p
23:55 <@JStoker> bikcmp, did it with the atheme-kl test servers
23:55 <@JStoker> heh ;p
23:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: atheme-kl?
23:55 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Yes. :p
23:55 <@bikcmp> ha y ou mean?
23:55 <@JStoker> no
23:55 <@bikcmp> what's kl
23:55 <@JStoker> Something cool.
23:55 <@bikcmp> i know that.
23:55 <@bikcmp> :P
23:56 <@bikcmp> what's kl mean?
23:56 <@JStoker> Something cool. ;p
23:56 <@bikcmp> Kill aLyx?
23:56 <@JStoker> Nah, heh
23:56 <@bikcmp> Kangaroo's Loo?
23:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: and i've looked at xmpp
23:56 <@bikcmp> i don't like it.
23:56 <@bikcmp> irc is the best way.
23:57 <@JStoker> eh
23:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm also considering custom coding a HA solution.
23:57 <@bikcmp> but
23:57 <@JStoker> msn is rather nice imo ;p
23:57 <@bikcmp> can you imagine.
23:57 <@bikcmp> lol
23:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: msn ikr
23:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: anyway yeah
23:57 <@bikcmp> i need a group chat/private chat solution.
23:57 <@JStoker> msn? ;p
23:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but msn doesn't cluster
23:57 <@bikcmp> and doesn't have the high avail i want
23:57 <@JStoker> bikcmp, HAHAHA, BULLSHIT.
23:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: eh?
23:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it does cluster ;p
23:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i thought you said all of the msnd's out there were single server?
23:58 <@bikcmp> if not i'll definitely look into msn
23:58 <@bikcmp> lol
23:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, of course they aren't
23:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hmm.
23:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: isn't msn propiertary?
23:58 <@bikcmp> or however
23:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, i'd highly suggest writing your own server, but
23:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but i'm bikcmp.
23:58 <@bikcmp> can you imagine.
23:59 <@bikcmp> i've made charybdis segfault and i haven't even modified it yet.
23:59 <@bikcmp> lol
--- Day changed Wed Aug 29 2012
00:00 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm modifying charybdis a bit to use something like HAproxy.
00:00 <@bikcmp> don't ask.
00:00  * JStoker coughs, HAproxy doesn't require any modifications...
00:00 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
00:00 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no.
00:01 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm changing ts6.
00:01 <@bikcmp> it won't be ts6, kinda.
00:01 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm making it so servers can rejoin without making any noise.
00:01 <@bikcmp> and, if needed, the server or a bot can send a 010 to a client.
00:01 <@JStoker> bikcmp, hmm
00:01 <@bikcmp> and automatically load balance and take care of misbehaving servers.
00:01 <@bikcmp> automatically route
00:01 <@bikcmp> etc
00:02 <@JStoker> don't massively see why it needs a ts6 change though
00:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
00:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm first going to see how complex it would be to have servers connected to multiple hubs.
00:02 <@JStoker> i seem to recall it's SQUIT/SERVER or something like that anyway, and if you have QS first
00:02 <@bikcmp> when hub1 fails, automatically take over and hit hub2.
00:02 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ... you realise it already has that?
00:02 <@bikcmp> but, if hub2 is responding normally, don't make any noise.
00:02 <@bikcmp> 05:02:31  <@bikcmp> but, if hub2 is responding normally, don't make any noise.
00:03 <@JStoker> just take care about desyncs
00:03 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm also going to either make a module in atheme or a bot that'll email me when there's a split
00:03 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yeah
00:03 <@bikcmp> JStoker: that's what i'm worried about.
00:03 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's a shame, i'd use ircu
00:03 <@JStoker> ... what?
00:03 <@bikcmp> well
00:03 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i really like ircu for some things.
00:03 <@bikcmp> lol
00:03 <@JStoker> how is ircu related to mesh routing...
00:04 <@alyx> no.
00:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
00:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it isn't
00:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm also not sure about mesh.
00:05 <@JStoker> that is what you're proposing though, so
00:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
00:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: either a redundant hub/hub thing
00:06 <@bikcmp> which, if transfers are successful, won't make any noise
00:06 <@bikcmp> or mesh, where all servers are connected.
00:06 <@JStoker> but, it's how to make it catch-up when there's a delay between disconnecting from A, and connecting to B.
00:08 <@bikcmp> hm
00:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: put it in a queue.
00:08 <@JStoker> bikcmp, and we're back to rabbitmq
00:09 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Wait, uh
00:09 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ok, and how do you propose to actually do the catch up?
00:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: burst.
00:09 <@JStoker> ... 'won't make any noise'?
00:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
00:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it'll make less noise than a huge quit/join.
00:10 <@bikcmp> it'll burst messages lost in the 2 seconds disconnected from the hubs.
00:10 <@JStoker> what if they'd already seen that message?
00:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: timestamp them.
00:11 <@JStoker> clock synchrony problems, short of running something like a paxos transaction on each protocol message, heh
00:11 <@bikcmp> hm
00:11 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it'll be an interesting challenge ;p
00:15 <@JStoker> bikcmp, certainly ;p

03:29 <@bikcmp> enjoy.
03:29 <@bikcmp> lol
03:29 <@JStoker> (also: YOU SHOULD HAVE DB BACKUPS)
03:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i do.
03:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: they're on amazon glacier.
03:29  * JStoker touches alyx's services.db
03:29 <@huru> hmm?
03:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: aka, if i want them, 5 hours.
03:29 <@JStoker> bikcmp, which can be brought up within a few seconds ;p
03:29 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, glacier takes hours.
03:29 <@JStoker> Oh god, that's horrible backups
03:29 <@bikcmp> but it's SO CHEAP.
03:29 <@bikcmp> lol
03:30 <@JStoker> well, no, that's probably ok for backups, but not for a failover node ;p
03:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: our failover node is in huru's possession
03:30 <@bikcmp> :P
03:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i've just made a pull request.
03:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: pray it'll be quick.
03:30 <@bikcmp> lol
03:30 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it should've been automatically sync'd ;p
03:30 <@bikcmp> in other news this is a good time to socialize :P
03:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: HOW WAS YOUR DAY
03:31 <@JStoker> bikcmp, hmm
03:31 <@JStoker> bikcmp, debatable.
03:31 <@bikcmp> just say good.
03:31 <@bikcmp> :P
03:31 <@JStoker> having to stay up since i couldn't get to sleep early, and have packages which should be coming today, which i really need.... Then gotta sort out $crap.
03:31 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what packages?
03:31 <@bikcmp> did you get ass tightning gel?
03:31 <@bikcmp> <.<
03:32 <@JStoker> Alyx went off a hour or so ago, which hasn't made me any less bored, in total, it's been okish
03:32 <@JStoker> bikcmp, xD
03:32 <@JStoker> bikcmp, nah, new hdd/enclosure, and a book
03:32 <@bikcmp> don't you have a kindle
03:32 <@bikcmp> lol
03:32 <@JStoker> yes?
03:32 <@bikcmp> books are odl!
03:32 <@bikcmp> old!
03:32  * JStoker still gets physical books though
03:33 <@bikcmp> lame
03:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so
03:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i've decided to, uh, improve charybdis
03:33 <@JStoker> bikcmp, How about yours? :-)
03:33 <@bikcmp> so this kinda stuff can't happen
03:33 <@bikcmp> :P
03:33 <@JStoker> bikcmp, heh
03:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i also have sane sids now
03:33 <@JStoker> ugh
03:33 <@JStoker> they were sane before?
03:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i also am implementing irc_redir
03:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: kinda.
03:33 <@bikcmp> JStoker: they were hexxed ipv4 ips.
03:34 <@JStoker> ... what the fu
03:34 <@bikcmp> JStoker: but, i quickly figured out that it won't work for ipv6.
03:34 <@bikcmp> lol
03:34 <@JStoker> 3 hex digits isn't enough to get an ip into a sid?
03:34 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i also made a script to autoconfigure charydbis
03:34 <@bikcmp> and link it.
03:34  * JStoker has one of those ;p
03:34 <@bikcmp> nice.
03:34 <@bikcmp> lol
03:34 <@JStoker> it really is
03:34 <@JStoker> ./test.sh and it just goes and does 'everything' for me
03:35 <@JStoker> lovely
03:35 <@JStoker> need to continue w/ that project though, heh
03:35 <@bikcmp> charybdis-dev (unknown). CHAT-60-01-01-AA. eHIKMpZ6 TS6ow 1AA
03:35 <@bikcmp> <3
03:35  * JStoker note to alyx: Did we sort out that todo list?
03:35 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ...
03:35 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
03:35 <@JStoker> tbh, i'd worry about doing the important things first
03:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: OK!
03:36 <@bikcmp> glacier is letting me download it :P
03:36 <@JStoker> how old is the backup?
03:36 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 10 minutes
03:36  * JStoker is rather tempted to go rewrite my msnd in erlang, hmm
03:37 <@JStoker> bikcmp, eh, not too bad
03:37 <@JStoker> wonder how sane it would be building a msn/ts6 server...
03:37 <@JStoker> probably not very, there's some stuff which just can't work
03:38 <@JStoker> ah well
03:39 <@JStoker> bikcmp, pick a letter, [aijm]
03:39 <@bikcmp> uh
03:39 <@bikcmp> j
03:39 <@JStoker> ;o
03:39 <@JStoker> k
03:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: fml
03:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: Network Maintenance in Dallas: August 30, 2012
03:40 <@bikcmp> Wednesday, August 1, 2012
03:40 <@bikcmp> 3:05pm (EDT): Network maintenance will be performed in our Dallas datacenter on Thursday, August 30th between 1:00am and 5:00am EDT. We do not expect any downtime during this maintenance, however a brief period of increased latency and/or packet loss may be observed.
03:40 <@bikcmp> lol
03:40 <@bikcmp> heyw ait
03:40 <@bikcmp> it's 8/30
03:40 <@JStoker> hmm
03:40 <@bikcmp> but today's 8/29
03:40 <@bikcmp> huru: yes
03:40 <@bikcmp> huru: let's move services.
03:40 <@bikcmp> huru: what do you need from me
03:40 <@huru> mk
03:40 <@bikcmp> i'd install atheme from git
03:40 <@huru> the config and dbs
03:40  * JStoker thinks we should have this sorta stuff piped in here, heh
03:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
03:40 <@bikcmp> JStoker: FEEL FREE
03:41 <@bikcmp> hint hint hint
03:41 <@bikcmp> lol
03:41 <@JStoker> to?
03:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: playing
03:41 <@JStoker> what sorta feed do linode do?
03:41 <@JStoker> if it's a somewhat sane one, 'll do it, no prob
03:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: looooooooool
03:42 <@bikcmp> Network Maintenance in Dallas: August 29, 2012
03:42 <@bikcmp> Wednesday, August 29, 2012
03:42 <@bikcmp> 4:15am (EDT): We're currently experiencing high packet loss in Dallas over IPv4. This is related to the maintenance and should be resolved shortly. As always, updates will be provided via this post.
03:42 <@bikcmp> lol
03:42 <@JStoker> lul
03:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: http://status.linode.com/blog/atom.xml
03:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: same thing will happen in an hour
03:43 <@bikcmp> huru: ok
03:43 <@bikcmp> huru: where do i send it.
03:43 <@huru> send it to ingramj25@gmail.com
03:43 <@bikcmp> i was about to say "no email"
03:43 <@bikcmp> i decided nto to
03:43 <@bikcmp> llol
03:43 <@bikcmp> lagging myself.
03:43 <@huru> easier for me
03:43 <@bikcmp> huru: any scp way to do it
03:43 <@huru> email is secure
03:43 <@JStoker> eg, an /actually secure/ one
03:43 <@bikcmp> it isn't.
03:43 <@JStoker> huru, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
03:44 <@huru> yeah because people really going to steal my emails <_<"
03:44 <@bikcmp> http://abcnews.go.com/Business/google-facebook-watching-online-behavioral-tracking-regulated/story?id=14623510
03:44 <@bikcmp> js
03:44 <@bikcmp> lol
03:44 <@bikcmp> but anyway
03:44 <@huru> bikcmp: got skype then
03:44 <@bikcmp> huru: like, scp.
03:44 <@bikcmp> ...
03:44 <@JStoker> ...
03:44 <@huru> file transfer boom, done
03:44 <@JStoker> eg, SECURE.
03:44 <@bikcmp> skype is getting better but like
03:44 <@bikcmp> it's still bad
03:44 <@bikcmp> lol
03:45 <@bikcmp> i'll just upload it to google drive.
03:45 <@JStoker> i'd probably say skype is worse, as it's proprietary, and you don't even remotely have the opportunity to have it secure
03:45 <@JStoker> that's no better tbh ;p
03:45 <@bikcmp> huru: https://aaaaaaaaaaaaag4889pdzw9ct9797gfnpdy1l9011e.googleusercontent.com/-G4889pDzW9c/T97GfNPDY1I/AAADAAAAJPA/BU-L9GfN_YI/w469-h351-o/services.db
03:45 <@huru> The requested URL /-G4889pDzW9c/T97GfNPDY1I/AAADAAAAJPA/BU-L9GfN_YI/w469-h351-o/services.db was not found on this server. That’s all we know.
03:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: google drive is really awesome
03:46 <@bikcmp> bah
03:46 <@bikcmp> huru: i didn't really put it up, i was hoping for a reaction by JStoker 
03:46 <@bikcmp> huru: but really.
03:46 <@JStoker> <@JStoker> that's no better tbh ;p
03:46 <@bikcmp> give me some secure way to do it.
03:46 <@JStoker> was my reaction
03:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: oh, i thought you meant re: skype
03:46 <@bikcmp> lol
03:46 <@huru> uh 
03:46 <@bikcmp> huru: got like, sftp
03:46 <@bikcmp> scp
03:46 <@JStoker> oh, no, <@JStoker> that's no better tbh ;p was against gdrive
03:47 <@bikcmp> huru: i only have a cli on this box
03:47 <@bikcmp> no skype
03:47 <@huru> true
03:47 <@bikcmp> (unless there's some cli based thing?)
03:47 <@bikcmp> but i'd also want to gpg encrypt it
03:47 <@bikcmp> huru: so like
03:47 <@bikcmp> huru: give me a way to scp it.
03:48 <@huru> err
03:48 <@huru> u still have access to zinc right?
03:48 <@bikcmp> no
03:48 <@bikcmp> i deleted all authentication details to zinc.
03:48 <@huru> mm
03:48 <@huru> i guess i can create a temp acc on lithium and ill get u to xfer it on that,i guess
03:49 <@bikcmp> ok
03:51  * JStoker makes a start on a sane irc lib for erlang
03:52 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i don't understand why i should use erlang over $lang
03:52 <@JStoker> bikcmp, depends entirely on what you're doing
03:52 <@bikcmp> JStoker: uh. 
03:52 <@bikcmp> an ircd.
03:52  * JStoker 'd probably consider it for an ircd tbh
03:52 <@bikcmp> ...?
03:52 <@JStoker> at least, for the scale we're looking at anyway
03:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, i mean like
03:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: why should i use erlang over python
03:53 <@JStoker> bikcmp, OK. First off: If you break something, it only affects a minimal set of people who need to be affected.
03:53 <@bikcmp> eh?
03:53 <@bikcmp> how so
03:54 <@JStoker> bikcmp, You have the distributed aspect, although is probably not totally appropriate for linking with... Although, signalling for mesh and stuff
03:54 <@JStoker> bikcmp, You have the whole supervision tree thing
03:54 <@JStoker> bikcmp, If something crashes, the tree'll restart it (given it's not over a 'sanity count')
03:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: is there an article or something that demos this?
03:55 <@JStoker> bikcmp, It's compile checked, is trivial to unit test most things (srsly), and you have a really powerful type checker in erlang
03:56 <@JStoker> http://learnyousomeerlang.com/supervisors however that may not make sense until you go through the rest of it
03:57 <@JStoker> bikcmp, (eg, if you have a bug in your ssl handler, yes, i know chary has a hack (ssld) to do smth similar to this, it will ONLY take down one connection.)
03:57 <@JStoker> Or, say, the irc parser, or whatever
03:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: bah
03:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: glacier 500'ed on me
03:57 <@bikcmp> lol
03:57 <@JStoker> Instead of coring the whole ircd, and taking all the connections, and requiring a stupidly huge piece of network io to start it back up
03:57 <@bikcmp> GOOD SIGN.
03:57 <@JStoker> WAHEY
03:57 <@JStoker> aww
03:57 <@JStoker> it's raining
03:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i love rain.
03:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, i usually do, but i don't feel like rain today
03:58 <@JStoker> seems the sky had a different opinion
03:58 <@JStoker> bikcmp, tbh, there's a load of reasons why you'd go for erlang
03:58 <@JStoker> i think the real question is why not
03:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
03:58 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i already know python.
03:59 <@bikcmp> why bother?
03:59 <@JStoker> bikcmp, not to mention, erlang has been battle-tested so that you know that the core OTP stuff /works/.
03:59 <@JStoker> bikcmp, because python is probably inappropriate
03:59 <@bikcmp> wtf
03:59 <@bikcmp> JStoker: From 72.14.3.29 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
03:59 <@bikcmp> and, otp?
04:00 <@bikcmp> on the pooper?
04:00 <@JStoker> bikcmp, although, that depends on if you're writing your own socket handly-stuff, or using someone elses (and if so, who's?)
04:00 <@JStoker> bikcmp, open telephony protocol, it's part of the stdlib, and is half the reason why erlang is awesome.)
04:00 <@bikcmp> oh.
04:00 <@JStoker> (although, if it didn't have otp, it'd still be awesome, just less so)
04:00 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i told you i hacked a tty
04:00 <@bikcmp> right?
04:00 <@bikcmp> lol
04:00 <@JStoker> ;-)
04:00 <@JStoker> no?
04:00 <@bikcmp> huru: fwiw, no updates
04:00 <@JStoker> and, define tty
04:00 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i made a tty/tdd device.
04:00 <@bikcmp> in python.
04:00 <@bikcmp> lol
04:01 <@JStoker> ah, neat! :D
04:01 <@huru> ah
04:01 <@bikcmp> why pay $300 for a tty machine
04:01 <@JStoker> ikr
04:01 <@bikcmp> when you could have one in python in an hour
04:01 <@bikcmp> lol
04:01 <@bikcmp> JStoker: makes calling tmobile for support tons easier
04:01 <@JStoker> github it!
04:01 <@JStoker> xD
04:01 <@bikcmp> they always say "call us at"
04:01 <@bikcmp> "we can't resolve this issue over live chat"
04:01 <@bikcmp> etc
04:01 <@bikcmp> then i'm like
04:01 <@JStoker> lol
04:01 <@JStoker> 'fuckyou'
04:01 <@bikcmp> i can't hear very well, can you just talk here
04:01 <@bikcmp> "THERE'S TTY"
04:01 <@bikcmp> who the fuck uses tty anymore
04:01 <@bikcmp> lol
04:01 <@JStoker> ikr
04:02 <@JStoker> hmm
04:02 <@JStoker> would this be done better as a gen_fsm, or as a gen_server
04:02 <@bikcmp> lol
04:03 <@JStoker> bikcmp, oh, and you have processes and messages, which is a much better way of doing things
04:03 <@bikcmp> well then
04:03 <@bikcmp> huru: i don't have a config.
04:03 <@bikcmp> huru: i have services.db and friends.
04:03 <@bikcmp> lol
04:03 <@huru> heh
04:04 <@bikcmp> huru: do you just want db
04:04 <@huru> fucking atheme wont even compile
04:04 <@JStoker> eg, (in this, at least) it'd be just a simple case of (well, no, as i'm wrapping this in otp, but) irc ! #message{channel="#staff", message="Hello! :D"}
04:04 <@JStoker> huru, Error?
04:04 <@huru> which is random as fuck
04:04 <@bikcmp> huru: error please
04:04 <@huru> cause it wont even compile on the box that ircnode runs on
04:04 <@huru> and it has atheme on it
04:04 <@huru> dafuq
04:04 <@bikcmp> ... yes
04:04 <@bikcmp> define won't let me
04:04  * JStoker wonders if it's the nls stuff
04:04 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i bet it's autoconf.
04:04 <@JStoker> probably
04:04 <@bikcmp> he didn't run autoconf/gen.

04:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i said to use git
04:05 <@huru> mowgli errors
04:05 <@JStoker> is that from git, or a tarball?
04:05 <@huru> git
04:05 <@bikcmp> no
04:05 <@JStoker> are you sure?
04:05 <@huru> git versions wont work at all
04:05 <@huru> yes
04:05 <@bikcmp> huru: did you git clone it?
04:05 <@JStoker> the directory is named weird for that
04:05 <@bikcmp> or download a git tarball
04:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think he tarballed it
04:05 <@JStoker> the tarballs don't work afaicr
04:05 <@huru> i dl a git tarball
04:05 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, i mean github tarballs
04:05 <@bikcmp> huru: git clone it
04:06 <@JStoker> yeah, they don't, afaicr
04:06 <@JStoker> oh wait, no, wrong project, ignore that
04:06 <@bikcmp> hm
04:06 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's that or wget a static version
04:06 <@bikcmp> but then patch flags/
04:06 <@JStoker> ;p
04:06 <@JStoker> i'd say get it from git://
04:07 <@JStoker> much saner
04:07 <@bikcmp> but will it fix his issue
04:07 <@JStoker> (since then, git checkout vx.y.z
04:07 <@JStoker> if it doesn't, it's much easier to debug
04:07 <@huru> i get the same error when i git clone it
04:07 <@huru> mowgli shit
04:07 <@bikcmp> huru: did you run ./configure?
04:07 <@huru> duh
04:07 <@huru> ofcourse
04:07 <@JStoker> huru, are you compiling straight from the git tree, or are you using a stable tag?
04:07 <@bikcmp> (i know, sorry, i need to ask these questions)
04:07 <@bikcmp> lol
04:07 <@JStoker> bikcmp, wouldn't get that far without
04:07 <@huru> yeah straight from git
04:08 <@bikcmp> ok
04:08 <@bikcmp> hm
04:08 <@bikcmp> no fucking idea.
04:08 <@bikcmp> lol
04:08 <@JStoker> huru, ok, checkout a stable tag
04:08 <@JStoker> because, not sure about anyone else, but i'd prefer to be on a stable ;p
04:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
04:08 <@bikcmp> JStoker: was stable updated to fix that exploit
04:09 <@JStoker> interesting, no
04:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hmm
04:09 <@JStoker> it's easy enough to patch manually though
04:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: go poke nenolod with a 500 watt tazer
04:09 <@bikcmp> (please!)
04:09 <@JStoker> no?
04:09 <@bikcmp> <.<
04:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: neno is pretty cool
04:09 <@bikcmp> JStoker: admittingly... like
04:09 <@bikcmp> when i think of nenolod
04:09 <@JStoker> it's his project, he can do what he likes
04:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think of jay leno when i think of nenolod
04:10 <@bikcmp> lol
04:10 <@JStoker> xD
04:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you do know who he is, right?
04:10 <@bikcmp> a talkshow host in the us
04:10 <@JStoker> i know of him
04:10 <@bikcmp> ah
04:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yeah
04:10 <@bikcmp> JStoker: he is cool
04:10 <@bikcmp> huru: luck?
04:10 <@JStoker> i think a fsm would work best for this really

04:11 <@bikcmp> lol
04:11 <@huru> i dont have time to deal with this tonight

04:12 <@JStoker> hm?

04:12 <@bikcmp> (twss)
04:12 <@bikcmp> lol
04:12 <@huru> cant we do this after tomorrow
04:12 <@JStoker> wasn't that what it was last time?
04:12 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, it just dropped
04:12 <@huru> when i finish work for the week?
04:12 <@bikcmp> huru: well

04:12 <@bikcmp> aside from bikcmp's laptop
04:12 <@bikcmp> lol
04:12 <@huru> what happened to h1?
04:12 <@bikcmp> huru: it got raped by alyx and friends
04:12 <@JStoker> if you give me a link block, i can do it, if absolutely needed
04:13 <@JStoker> (for obvious reasons however, this is not preferred)
04:13 <@bikcmp> JStoker: give h1 a few mins
04:13 <@huru> bikcmp: uh what?
04:13 <@bikcmp> i /think/ it's coming up ;p
04:13 <@bikcmp> huru: the network dropped on it
04:13 <@bikcmp> huru: be warned though
04:13 <@bikcmp> huru: this very very well might mean this will happen tomorrow
04:13 <@bikcmp> so if it comes up i'd be careful with it
04:13 <@bikcmp> dallas is having problems.

04:41 <@JStoker> 404?
04:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: playing
04:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: man you're a bit late
04:41 <@bikcmp> lol
04:41 <@JStoker> bikcmp, stalkstalk connection
04:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: ikr
04:41 <@bikcmp> lol
04:41 <@bikcmp> JStoker: wait, is it?
04:42 <@bikcmp> also, i would never trust an isp with the name 'stalk stalk'
04:42 <@bikcmp> just sayign
04:42 <@JStoker> takes about a minute for a connection to properly complete, heh
04:42 <@JStoker> bikcmp, it's really talktalk, but they stalk their customers, so hence the nickname
04:42 <@bikcmp> lol
04:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: do they?
04:42 <@JStoker> Yep! :D
04:43 <@JStoker> bikcmp, If I make a http request to somewhere, within a minute, another one will be made by some stalkstalk-run monitoring system. I have verified this behaviour. :-)
04:43 <@JStoker> There is no opt out (short of changing ISP)
04:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: really?
04:43 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Yes. :-)
04:43 <@JStoker> bikcmp, I know, I'm not very happy about it either.
04:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: sounds like the terrorist act.
04:43 <@bikcmp> (aka patriot act in the us)
04:44 <@JStoker> oh, that crap
04:44 <@bikcmp> 'if it's about terrorism we can do anything'
04:44 <@JStoker> no, it's to increase their antivirus db (which we're opted out from, so OUR REQUESTS SHOULDN'T BE USED FOR THAT)
04:44 <@JStoker> infact, i think they charge for the av thing, bitches...
04:45 <@bikcmp> lol
04:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tunnel into your servers?
04:45 <@JStoker> fscking bastards...
04:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, heh, tor ;p
04:45 <@bikcmp> ... ew
04:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: again, tunnel into your servers?
04:45 <@bikcmp> lol
04:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, depends what i'm wanting to do ;p
04:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: oh. i get it, you use tor for all of your sexual needs
04:45 <@bikcmp> no need to explai
04:45 <@bikcmp> n
04:45 <@JStoker> xD
04:45 <@bikcmp> lol
04:46 <@JStoker> vpn for anything important, but most stuff can just be done over tor tbh
04:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tor is significantly slower though
04:46 <@JStoker> bikcmp, not on a stalkstalk connection
04:46 <@bikcmp> ... that's sad
04:46 <@bikcmp> wow.
04:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: have you considered sat internet
04:46 <@bikcmp> lol
04:46 <@JStoker> bikcmp, if it was up to me, we'd switch isp's
04:47 <@bikcmp> lol
04:47 <@bikcmp> JStoker: your parents are the type that are like
04:47 <@bikcmp> 'if it works it works'?
04:47 <@bikcmp> i personally hate comcast
04:47 <@bikcmp> for their connection
04:47 <@bikcmp> but i hate verizon for their ethics
04:47 <@bikcmp> lol
04:47 <@JStoker> trwtf, was we were with one of the isp's which got bought out by one of the isp's stalkstaklk bought out, when we had ZERO downtime in 4+ years, and a constant 80k/s
04:48 <@JStoker> now, get slightly more, but it's down every few hours, heh
04:48 <@JStoker> bikcmp, no, it doesn't work (they just can't be bothered)
04:48 <@bikcmp> 80 k/s!
04:48 <@bikcmp> wow
04:48 <@bikcmp> lol
04:48 <@bikcmp> JStoker: my phone gets 25 mbps :P
04:49 <@JStoker> heh, not at the time we signed up with them ;p
04:50 <@JStoker> bikcmp, oh, and they throttle like heck
04:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tmobile?
04:50 <@bikcmp> eh
04:50 <@JStoker> and the latency has went up a load
04:50 <@JStoker> bikcmp, no, stalkstalk
04:50 <@bikcmp> i get decent speeds with tmobile when they throttle
04:50 <@bikcmp> oh
04:50 <@bikcmp> lol
04:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm on the plan they give to deaf people
04:50 <@JStoker> not to mention, the support is dreadful
04:50 <@bikcmp> though i think they opoened up the plan to the public
04:50 <@JStoker> aah, awesome
04:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: aka
04:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: "give us your minutes and we'll give you unlimited texting and internet"
04:51 <@bikcmp> lol
04:51 <@JStoker> xD
04:51 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i can also makes calls over gvoice ;p
04:51 <@bikcmp> lol
04:51 <@JStoker> lol
04:51 <@bikcmp> JStoker: 'unlimited' for tmobile means they throttle you after 5 gigs
04:51 <@bikcmp> i hit 5 gigs before
04:51 <@JStoker> lolwtf
04:51 <@bikcmp> went from 15, 20 mbps to like, 5
04:51 <@bikcmp> but still
04:51 <@bikcmp> lol
04:51 <@JStoker> at least it's better than my current carrier, heh
04:52 <@bikcmp> JStoker: anyway yeah
04:52 <@bikcmp> i can feel the cancer already.
04:52 <@bikcmp> lol
04:52 <@JStoker> bikcmp, £1/25M, after the first 25M, you pay £1/M up to I think it's 100M
04:52 <@bikcmp> wait
04:52 <@bikcmp> for home internet?
04:52 <@JStoker> no
04:52 <@JStoker> mobile ;p

04:53 <@JStoker> bikcmp, really?
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: yep
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: tbh you should check to see if tmo has the plan in the uk
04:53 <@JStoker> not x/month?
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: kinda.
04:53 <@JStoker> no, becasue tmobile are arseholes, but anyway
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's not pay as you go so to say
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
04:53 <@JStoker> bikcmp, is it one of these 1-month contract things?
04:53 <@bikcmp> it is actuall
04:53 <@bikcmp> y
04:53 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it depends.
04:53 <@bikcmp> you could pay more to have it day-by-day.
04:53 <@bikcmp> $3 a day i think
04:54 <@bikcmp> or you could pay $30 to have it for a month.
04:54 <@bikcmp> but still i could cancel at any time
04:55 <@JStoker> lol?
04:56 <@bikcmp> fail
04:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm lagging badly now

05:50 <@bikcmp> if it's fedex/ups, no
05:51 <@JStoker> unknown
05:51 <@bikcmp> ...how
05:51 <@bikcmp> JStoker: amazon?
05:51 <@JStoker> aye
05:51 <@bikcmp> ups
05:51 <@bikcmp> night
05:51 <@bikcmp> lol
05:51  * JStoker usually gets amazon things from the post office, heh
05:51 <@JStoker> or, royal mail even
05:51 <@bikcmp> royal mail
05:51 <@bikcmp> loooooool
05:52 <@JStoker> although, two of them aren't coming from amazon themselves, so who knows
05:52 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how do you know they'll be here today
05:53 <@JStoker> just got told 'they'll probably arrive today'
05:53 <@bikcmp> inb4 they don't
05:53 <@bikcmp> lol
05:53 <@JStoker> probably not
05:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: so
05:56 <@bikcmp> JStoker: have you /tried/ g+
05:56 <@bikcmp> lol
05:57 <@JStoker> yes, it's confusing
05:57 <@bikcmp> i know you don't like it because of the 'hey join g+'
05:57 <@bikcmp> oh?
05:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think fb is confusing as shit
05:57 <@JStoker> so is g+
05:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: hm
05:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i think g+ is pretty good in that respect
05:57  * bikcmp shrugs
05:59 <@JStoker> it isn't though ;p
05:59 <@bikcmp> ;p
06:15 <@JStoker> bikcmp, yep, royal mail
06:17 <@JStoker> bikcmp, advantage of this publisher is that they give you the ebook for free w/ the book, which is somewhat nice
06:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: nice
06:42 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what publisher?
06:42 <@bikcmp> also like
06:42 <@bikcmp> it's 9 am
06:42 <@JStoker> manning ;p
06:42 <@bikcmp> and i'm going on a trip
06:42 <@bikcmp> so like
06:43 <@JStoker> lol
06:43 <@bikcmp> morning
06:43 <@bikcmp> lol
06:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i forgot
06:43 <@JStoker> morning! ;p
06:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm going to a trip 90 miles away today
06:43 <@JStoker> xD
06:43 <@bikcmp> ... in 20 minutes
06:43 <@bikcmp> so
06:43 <@bikcmp> like
06:43 <@bikcmp> yeah
06:43 <@bikcmp> lol
06:43 <@JStoker> sleep in the car ;p
06:43 <@bikcmp> should i even bother trying to sleep for 20 mins
06:43 <@bikcmp> lol
06:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: no, i'm the one who's getting us there
06:43 <@bikcmp> lol
06:43 <@JStoker> eek?
06:43 <@bikcmp> ikr
06:43 <@bikcmp> lol
06:43 <@bikcmp> JStoker: you'll find me on the news
06:43 <@bikcmp> BIKCMP DIES, LONG LIVE LILO
06:43 <@bikcmp> lol
06:43 <@JStoker> lol
06:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: luckily i think my mom's license was renewed
06:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: she let it expire
06:44 <@bikcmp> lol
06:44 <@JStoker> ;o
06:44 <@bikcmp> 18 minutes
06:44 <@bikcmp> <.<
06:44 <@bikcmp> lol
06:44 <@bikcmp> JStoker: what book
06:44 <@bikcmp> i've been kinda getting into books ;p
06:45 <@JStoker> rabbitmq in action (and if you want to get into erlang, erlang/otp in action is brilliant)
06:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: maybe
06:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i'm learning SEE though
06:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, /me 'd highly suggest not driving when tired ;p
06:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, SEE?
06:45 <@bikcmp> JStoker: well
06:45 <@bikcmp> PSE i guess
06:45 <@JStoker> bikcmp, Stupid electrical eel?
06:45 <@bikcmp> no...
06:46 <@JStoker> Pissed energetic e...rlang?
06:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: http://deafness.about.com/cs/signfeats2/a/pidginsign.htm
06:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: basically
06:46 <@bikcmp> JStoker: signed exact english
06:46 <@bikcmp> minus unneeded words.
06:46 <@JStoker> aah
06:47 <@bikcmp> "the book" => "book"
06:47 <@bikcmp> "how are you doing?" => "how you"
06:47 <@JStoker> but how do you define between "a book" and "the book"?!
06:47 <@bikcmp> say the whole sentence
06:47 <@bikcmp> like show me how you'd use that
06:47 <@JStoker> god knows
06:47 <@JStoker> too tired to think of english
06:48 <@bikcmp> JStoker: "is that a new book" => "book new"
06:48 <@bikcmp> JStoker: "there's the book" => "there book"?
06:48 <@bikcmp> lol
06:48 <@JStoker> hmm
06:48 <@bikcmp> it's stupid english
06:48 <@bikcmp> lol
06:48 <@JStoker> yeah, i was thinking that
06:48 <@JStoker> should suit you perfectly fine! :p *hides*
06:48 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it's practically asl, just not using asl's syntax
06:48 <@JStoker> ahhh
06:48 <@bikcmp> asl syntax is fucking weird
06:48 <@bikcmp> i know a bit but like
06:48 <@bikcmp> it's weird.
06:49 <@bikcmp> VERY different.
06:49  * JStoker 'd suggest learning erlang too just to screw you up even more
06:49 <@bikcmp> JStoker: "father, sons, how many?"
06:49 <@bikcmp> that's asl
06:49 <@JStoker> ;o
06:49 <@bikcmp> so weird
06:49 <@bikcmp> lol
06:50 <@JStoker> What I could do with is a decent tool to help with modelling erlang systems though :(
06:50 <@bikcmp> lol
06:50 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i learned a ton of sign really fucking fast
06:50 <@JStoker> :o
06:50 <@JStoker> well done!
06:50 <@bikcmp> easiest language i've ever learned.
06:51 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i have videos of me signing somewhere
06:51 <@bikcmp> although it makes me look like a minority in that lighting
06:51 <@bikcmp> i would look 1000 times different in lighting.
06:51 <@JStoker> Ooi, when are you going to *poof* away? :o
06:51 <@JStoker> bikcmp, ;-)
06:51 <@bikcmp> JStoker: as it turns out
06:51 <@bikcmp> it was changed to 3 pm
06:51 <@bikcmp> so i'm good
06:51 <@bikcmp> and taking a train
06:51 <@bikcmp> lol
06:51 <@JStoker> if it's in eighty billion hours, i'll go, if it's in 10 seconds i'll stay, if it's in between, eh ;p
06:51 <@JStoker> ah, even better!
06:52 <@bikcmp> you'll go?
06:52 <@bikcmp> lol
06:52 <@bikcmp> what do you mean you'll go?
06:52 <@JStoker> eg, sleep
06:52 <@bikcmp> why would you stay?
06:52 <@bikcmp> lol
06:52 <@JStoker> to talk to you? ;p
06:52 <@JStoker> to continue reading?
06:52 <@bikcmp> wow.
06:52 <@bikcmp> oh
06:52 <@bikcmp> lol
06:52 <@JStoker> to continue attempting to google but failing spectacularly?
06:52 <@JStoker> and, music ;p
06:53 <@bikcmp> how can you not google?
06:53 <@JStoker> bikcmp, try to find a decent tool for doing modelling of erlang systems..
06:53 <@JStoker> it's harder than it looks
06:53 <@bikcmp> that's why i don't care for erlang
06:53 <@JStoker> hehe
06:54 <@bikcmp> too complex imo
06:54 <@JStoker> it's not complex tbh
06:54 <@bikcmp> to you. 
06:54 <@JStoker> it's just... slightly more structured
06:54 <@JStoker> (although, you can just go 'fuck structure' and do it your own way, but that's not as good in the long run)
06:54 <@bikcmp> yeah
06:54 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i like really dynamic languages.
06:54 <@JStoker> what about them?
06:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: eg python
06:55 <@JStoker> not which, what? ;P
06:55 <@bikcmp> like what do you mean
06:55 <@JStoker> what do you like about dynamic languages?
06:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: how stupidly easy they are
06:55 <@bikcmp> lol
06:55 <@JStoker> (not to mention, erlang isn't statically typed)
06:55 <@JStoker> fact(1) -> 1; fact(N) -> N * fact(N-1).
06:55 <@bikcmp> JStoker: python is readable.
06:55 <@JStoker> How on earth is that not readable?
06:56 <@bikcmp> well
06:56 <@bikcmp> there are more complex operators in erlang.
06:56 <@bikcmp> from what i've seen.
06:56 <@JStoker> no, there isn't
06:56 <@JStoker> such as?
06:56 <@JStoker> !?
06:56 <@bikcmp> it loves {}'s.
06:56 <@JStoker> That's just like () in python
06:56 <@JStoker> (tuples)
06:57 <@bikcmp> hmmmmmmmmm
06:57 <@JStoker> and/or dictionaries, depending on what you're doing
06:57 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i dunno ;p
06:57 <@bikcmp> maybe.
06:57 <@JStoker> it's just a different syntax ;p
06:57  * JStoker thinks there's a rubyish language for the erlang vm somewhere
06:57 <@JStoker> http://elixir-lang.org/ which isn't terribly nice
06:58 <@JStoker> http://reia-lang.org/ which is nicer
06:58 <@bikcmp> hmm
06:58 <@bikcmp> elixir is more rubyish.
06:58 <@bikcmp> for sure.
06:59 <@JStoker> i'd probably say reia is more rubyish, and elixir slightly more python, but that's just me
07:01 <@bikcmp> hm
07:01 <@bikcmp> JStoker: i like exlixir.
07:01 <@bikcmp> lol
07:01 <@JStoker> awesome ;p
07:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYbczABe6g&feature=player_detailpage#t=25s
07:02 <@JStoker> tbh, i think it just adds more syntaxy stuff onto it, heh
07:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: fucking FUNNY
07:02 <@bikcmp> don't play near parents
07:02 <@bikcmp> JStoker: dsome dudes at walmart wanted to do a prank
07:02 <@bikcmp> they recorded saying really funny things on a cd
07:02 <@bikcmp> then put it in a stereo at walmart
07:02 <@bikcmp> lol
07:03 <@JStoker> might go get some food
07:03 <@bikcmp> ok
07:03 <@bikcmp> morning
07:03 <@bikcmp> lol
07:04 <@JStoker> here's hoping the other two things'll arrive today...
07:16 <@JStoker> disadvantage of smth like exlixir is that there'll be much less resources available for learning it, heh
07:37 <@JStoker> one thing i do like about elixir is that it does the whole orddict stuff in syntax instead of function calls
07:50 <@bikcmp> ordict?
07:50 <@bikcmp> also, for reals this time, night
07:50 <@bikcmp> lol
13:26 <@JStoker> no, orddict
13:26 <@JStoker> ordered dictionary
13:35 -!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: +Xanos, @ChanServ
