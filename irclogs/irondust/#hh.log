01:37 <@`> gimmeh questions again, please.
01:37 < interwarbls> [23:32] <interwarbls> gonna do a pingtest of cdn's tomorrow
01:37 < interwarbls> [23:32] <interwarbls> what less-shitty network tests can I do?
01:37 < interwarbls> [23:32] <interwarbls> thorughput is likely important too, but I dunno how to measure it.
01:37 <@`> ask Sue
01:37 < interwarbls> you ask him, he's at your fucking abode
01:38 <@`> lols
01:39 < interwarbls> Sue:) DICKS ^
01:45 < interwarbls> Why do I spend so much time waiting for chrome to coordinate its actions
01:45 < interwarbls> the main CPU consumer process of chrome is the parent process
01:45 < interwarbls> indeed, it's the main consumer on my entire computer
01:46 < interwarbls> I'm really fucking tired of this
01:47 < interwarbls> I open a tab and have to wait >15seconds for chrome to open it
01:47 < interwarbls> Every other operation on my computer happens instantaneously
02:07 < interwarbls> I'm just going to rage until I can manage to restart chrome in a few days
02:07 < interwarbls> :>
02:22 <@Sue> lol

17:16 < interwarbls> hahaha win
17:16 < interwarbls> I finally know why chrome runs so slowly on an atom
17:16 < interwarbls> 32bit chrome sandboxing model uses segment registers, and atoms don't have a real implementation of those. So it's slower than shit to use chrome's sandbox.

22:56 < interwarbls> also, the fuck is koth
22:58 < interwarbls> Sue: Jesus christ, their ping is unstable as shit
23:00 < interwarbls> nevermind, my faggot roommate had his vuze set on auto
23:01 < interwarbls> their metrics are terrible, apparently
23:01 < interwarbls> my utorrent on auto is quite fine
23:05 <@`> Vuze is banned by the trackers i'm on
23:05 <@`> aka it's fucking PURE shit
23:07 <@bikcmp> lol
23:07 <@bikcmp> `: vuze sucks ass
23:08 <@`> exactly
23:09 < interwarbls> not my choice
23:09 <@`> i need to figure out how to block packets by certain software on my router
23:09 <@bikcmp> `: when are you and sue going to learn sign already
23:09 <@bikcmp> sue is laaaaaaaazy
23:09 <@bikcmp> haha
23:09 <@`> so i can be all LOL BLOCK VUZE, SUCK MY DONG
23:09 < interwarbls> I want to disable dht too, but vuze is sort of based on it
23:10 < interwarbls> so I settled for turning his upload speed from auto to 125kbyte, and turning on udp traffic preffered
23:11 < interwarbls> also enabling and prefering protocol encryption
23:11 < interwarbls> none of those are turned on by default
23:11 < interwarbls> >_>
23:11 < interwarbls> shit client, seriously
23:11 < interwarbls> so we should be good now
23:12 < interwarbls> even his rampant disregard for how things work shouldn't bother me
23:12 < interwarbls> I'm still going to actually light him on fire while he's sleeping if I get a letter from charter because of some shit /he/ downloads
23:14 <@bikcmp> lol
23:14 <@bikcmp> interwarbls: hi, we noticed you're downloading tons of japanese porno.  please stop.
23:15 < interwarbls> I wish it were japanese porno, I'd just ask him to share
23:15 < interwarbls> mostly it's movies I already have
23:16 < interwarbls> and because he's a fucking cunt and a retard, he refuses to learn how to simply ftp them off my computer at blistering speeds
23:16 < interwarbls> I'd have him join our homegroup, but his faggoty computer won't talk to us
23:16 <@bikcmp> aw
23:16 < interwarbls> cause that shit is easymode if it works
23:17 < interwarbls> and of fucking course, all my shit is ALSO shared over homegroup
23:17 < interwarbls> videos in video library, etc, I even have a lib for my torrents directories
23:17 < interwarbls> Can't get much more retard friendly
23:17 <@bikcmp> silly
23:17 <@bikcmp> interwarbls: but wait
23:17 <@bikcmp> you can
23:17 <@bikcmp> upload them to youtube.
23:17 <@bikcmp> :)
23:17 <@bikcmp> lol
23:18 <@`> interwarbls: then block the HELL out of him
23:18 <@`> and THEN blame it on his shitty computer
23:19 < interwarbls> can't, don't own the router anymore
23:19 <@`> i would definitely have NO obligation to serve the bastard.
23:19 <@`> interwarbls: etherkill his computer
23:19 <@`> interwarbls: problem solved.
23:20 < interwarbls> no idea what that is, but since it has eth in it I'll assume it doesn't apply because he's on wireless
23:20 <@`> http://dgd.io/erF8
23:20 <@`> THAT is a etherkiller
23:20 <@`> would fry the fuck out of the computer
23:21  * interwarbls shrugs
23:21 < interwarbls> I'm not that much of a dick
23:21 < interwarbls> I'd rather just adjust his settings without asking
23:21 <@`> well, i was
23:21 < interwarbls> knowing he'll never notice
23:21 <@`> etherkilled an entire network of computers at school
23:21 <@`> by plugging the damn thing DIRECTLY into a switch
23:21 < interwarbls> lol
23:21 <@`> i did them a favor, really
23:21 <@`> fucking windows 98 machines in 2004
23:21 < interwarbls> I'm surprised the eth carried the current
23:22 < interwarbls> I'm not going to say anything
23:22 <@`> then ALL OF THE SUDDEN
23:22 <@`> upgrade to winXP machines
23:22 <@`> honestly
23:22 <@`> they were bad
23:22 <@`> took 30 minutes to boot
23:22 <@`> if that.
23:23 <@`> and the 98 machines used some bullshit "freeze" software
23:23 <@`> that would revert everything at every reboot
23:23 < interwarbls> My grandmother still ran win98se on computers at her school as recently as 2009
23:23 < interwarbls> She was the IT person
23:23 <@bikcmp> ... lol
23:23 < interwarbls> Wanna know how well they worked?
23:23 <@bikcmp> they didn't!
23:23 < interwarbls> Fucking beautifully.
23:23 < interwarbls> You want to know what new operating systems don't run?
23:23 < interwarbls> educational software.
23:24 <@bikcmp> BAHAHAHA EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE
23:24 <@bikcmp> <.<
23:24 < interwarbls> Especially educational software made for windows 98.
23:24 < interwarbls> None of it has been updated.
23:24 <@bikcmp> interwarbls: tbh. i kinda like windows 98
23:24 < interwarbls> It was the only good OS they made
23:24 < interwarbls> It's the only one I've found to be actually stable
23:24 < interwarbls> Not anymore due to viruses and whatnot
23:24 < interwarbls> but back then? rock fucking solid
23:25 < interwarbls> keep that shit off the internet (the games don't need it anyway) and they'll run for another two decades
23:25 < interwarbls> my grandma's a boss
23:26 < interwarbls> her network had win 95->7 on the same network
23:26 < interwarbls> every single version
23:26 < interwarbls> And they all interfaced (the newer ones!) with the same server 2003 adv box
23:27 < interwarbls> that's fucking prowess right there

17:42  * ` runs away again.
17:43  * Aranje shrugs
17:43 <@`> what sucks
17:43 <@`> is http://google.com weather 92399
17:44 <@Aranje> hot?
17:44 <@`> even my a/c is struggling
17:44  * Aranje shrugs
17:44 <@Aranje> nice and cool here
17:44 <@Aranje> crisp 75
17:44 <@`> lol imma murder you and move in
17:44 <@`> }:A
17:44 <@Aranje> n.n
17:44 <@`> lolnotrly
17:44 <@`> so what's up
17:45 <@Aranje> fuckall
17:45 <@`> heh
17:45 <@Aranje> sue walked away with lol running again
17:45 <@Aranje> I'm still not sure why he does that
17:45  * ` shrugs
17:45 <@Aranje> It rapes cpu when it's open in the background
17:45 <@Aranje> the store shit is adobe air
17:45 <@Aranje> aka not efficient at ALL
17:46 <@`> tell Sue that
17:46 <@Aranje> I would but he's not paying attention to it
17:46 <@`> and he's the one in the hottest room in the house
17:46 <@Aranje> lol
17:46 <@Aranje> oh?
17:46 <@`> he's probably frying his CPU as we speak
17:46 <@Aranje> geographically or because of computers
17:46 <@Aranje> lol
17:46 <@`> geographically in his room, his room is the hottest
17:46 <@Aranje> highest in the house?
17:46 <@Aranje> o so
17:46 <@Aranje> or so
17:47 <@`> nope, ground-floor house
17:47 <@`> he has no a/c
17:47 <@`> he needs to get one
17:47 <@Aranje> ahh
17:47 <@`> i've been finding a bunch of real good $50 ones on craigslist
17:47 <@Aranje> he toootally won't
17:48 <@`> yeah, except it's essential
17:48 <@Aranje> be the nagging wife
17:48 <@Aranje> that was my old job
17:48 <@`> i'd probably be naked on the damn floor if not for my a/c
17:48 <@Aranje> I confer this responsibility to you
17:49 <@`> i'll hafta get some weather sensors and hook them to a linux box
17:49 <@`> outside, and then internal temps
17:49 <@`> maybe run motion with webcams
17:49 <@Aranje> set it up so it turns on the coolers automatically
17:50 <@`> difficult to do considering if you shut off power to it, you have to manually turn it on
17:50 <@`> it's some kenmore a/c
17:50 <@Aranje> outside box?
17:50 <@`> window a/c
17:50 <@Aranje> well uh
17:50 <@Aranje> you just rewire it
17:50 <@Aranje> a/c's aren't complicated at all
17:50 <@`> lol no, they're not
17:50 <@`> i just rather not fuck with my only a/c
17:51 <@`> if i get a 2nd one, sure
17:51 <@Aranje> well that's boring
17:51 <@`> yeah, well
17:51 <@`> it's really hot here
17:51 <@`> and i cant stand even 5 minutes of the sweltering heat
17:51 <@Aranje> well, then there's impetus to not fuck it up 
17:51 <@`> heh
17:52 <@Aranje> dude fucking piffle
17:52 <@`> been drinking some water.
17:52 <@Aranje> It's 95 at your house
17:52 <@Aranje> you don't even get to complain
17:52 <@Aranje> that's not even hot
17:52 <@Aranje> Hot is 112.
17:53 <@`> according to google its 102
17:53 <@Aranje> Hot is 118 or 122
17:53 <@Aranje> http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=92399
17:53 <@`> but due to how the house is constructed (fucking metal roof), it's actually a bit hotter
17:53 <@`> and the fact that the house comes under DIRECT sunlight all day
17:53  * Aranje shrugs
17:53 <@Aranje> insulate the roof
17:53 <@`> my room is
17:54 <@`> but heres the thing
17:54 <@`> Sue's room's not
17:54 <@`> so it's like a farking sauna in there
17:54 <@Aranje> why phrase that like an excuse?
17:54 <@`> he uses a bunch of fans to keep the air circulating, though
17:54 <@Aranje> so insulate it or tell him to
17:54 <@Aranje> lol
17:54 <@`> lol, he wont
17:54 <@Aranje> then do it yourlse
17:54 <@Aranje> yourself
17:54 <@`> dont have the materials for it.
17:54  * ` shrugs
17:54 <@Aranje> make em :D
17:55 <@`> i'm thinking of getting foam mix
17:55 <@Aranje> or buy them, but that's less fun
17:55 <@`> and foam the edges
17:55 <@Aranje> blankets stapled to the roof does the same thing
17:55 <@`> that'd help with insulation, ill do it to my room too
17:55 <@Aranje> I seal windows with curtains and shit
17:55 <@`> i also need to do a bit of rewiring
17:55 <@Aranje> cause my house is old as fuck
17:55 <@`> yeah
17:55 <@`> i have single-paned windows
17:55 <@`> giant ones
17:56 <@Aranje> so even just having proper window curtains drops our energy costs
17:56 <@Aranje> lol
17:56 <@`> so they insulate nothing
17:56 <@Aranje> ours aren't huge, but there's tons of em
17:56 <@`> yeha
17:56 <@Aranje> no less than 2 per wall
17:56 <@Aranje> lol
17:56 <@Aranje> every wall :|
17:56 <@`> im wanting to get the binary and pi fleece blankets
17:56 <@`> and cover my 2 windows with 'em
17:56 <@`> simple but effective
17:56 <@Aranje> lol
17:56 <@Aranje> yap
17:57 <@`> oh nice
17:57 <@`> i can feel the temps dropping finally
17:57 <@`> usually after 3:45-4, temps drop since the sun is at such an angle that it doesn't hit the house as much
17:57 <@Aranje> yup
17:57 <@`> im at the point
17:58 <@`> i'm considering constructing a solar water heater
17:58 <@`> basically a shitload of alumium cans
17:58 <@`> painted waterproof black
17:58 <@Aranje> I used to do field work with my mom out in the desert east of you
17:58 <@`> 29 palms?
17:58 <@Aranje> roughly, yeah
17:58 <@Aranje> little north
17:58 <@`> victorville-ish?

20:48 <@bikcmp> `:  You are under 18 and will need a parent or guardian to register your Personalized Card by calling (866) 785-6963. If they are unable to do so, you can continue with the registration of only your temporary card. The temporary card cannot be reloaded and has no PIN access. You will only be able to spend the funds on the card. If you choose this option, you will no longer be able to request a personalized card.
20:48 <@`> Yep.
20:48 <@`> inb4 your parents wont do it
20:53 <@bikcmp> ikr
20:56 < Joey> so i edited sites-enabled for nginx to add a subdomain

14:32 <@bikcmp> `: i'm trying to decide if i should do the web based thing.
14:33 <@bikcmp> `: i want all 'irondust' account operations to be done on the web.
14:33 <@bikcmp> it'll make it a /fuckload/ easier for me to do stuff.
14:33 <@bikcmp> but, users can't modify stuff like their email using nickserv anymore if i did this
14:33 <@bikcmp> or register.
14:33 <@bikcmp> thoughts?
14:41 <@`> bikcmp: i think it should stay irc-based
14:42 <@bikcmp> `: you do? :(
14:43 <@bikcmp> `: frankly i think tht it would be great this way
15:09 <@`> yeah, i do.
15:14 <@bikcmp> hm
15:14 <@bikcmp> `: even for just /account/ operations?
15:14 <@bikcmp> you'd need to go to the site to register, to delete your account and change your email.
15:14 <@bikcmp> lol
17:59 <@`> yeah, no
17:59 <@`> irc is irc
17:59 <@`> you can plug web-based ifaces to it, but the primary mode of access/maintainence must be via irc itself
18:06 <@`> i know of unreal/anope setups that is able to plug a web-based iface to the anope database
18:07 <@`> and scaled very well.

17:17 <@Aranje> wow partial blindness is a new experience
17:17 <@Aranje> I think it's the caffeine :/
17:19 <@`> lol
17:21 <@Aranje> Huh
17:21 <@Aranje> It's like afterimages
17:21 <@Aranje> But I've done nothing
17:23 <@Aranje> getting better though
17:23 <@Aranje> I think
17:23 <@Aranje> hmm, both eyes
17:23 <@Aranje> so it's not an eye problem
17:24 <@`> ;w2
17:25 <@`> ah
17:25 <@`> whats up?
17:25 <@`> is it fading?
17:25 <@Aranje> It just changed, didn't actually fade
17:25 <@Aranje> I can read text now
17:26 <@Aranje> I couldn't before, had no ability to recognize shape
17:26 <@Aranje> Still, the right side of my vision is pretty fucking blown right now
17:27 <@Aranje> There's a crescent of fuzz
17:27 <@Aranje> Looks like snow flakes on a tv
17:43 <@Aranje> fixed :D
17:44 <@`> by consuming activated charcoal?
17:58 <@Aranje> vomiting? Hell no.
17:59 <@Aranje> I defocused my eyes and chilled for bit, enjoying the sensation
