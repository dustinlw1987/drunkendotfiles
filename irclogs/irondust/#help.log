11:15 < snivy> aaaaaa
11:15 < snivy> alyx bikcmp jstoker what happened to the bouncer
11:16 < snivy> what happened to spitfire
11:16 <@alyx> snivy: he uh, resigned
11:17 < snivy> what about my bouncer
11:17 <@JStoker> heh, it was being used to abuse a channel, by one of the users, and the person hosting the bouncer didn't stop it, so he obviously should be fired, and the person who abused it shouldn't be
11:17 < snivy> now
11:17 <@JStoker> and, obviously he isn't providing the bouncer anymore
11:17 < snivy> why is my bouncer reconnecting
11:17 < snivy> i cant get rid of it
11:17 < snivy> i cant connect to it or control it either
11:17 < snivy> its nick is MichelFP
11:17 < snivy> kline it?
11:18 < snivy> also... that channel abuse. was it #smbx ?
11:22 < snivy> jstoker?
11:23 <@JStoker> Yeah.
11:24 < snivy> jstoker, it was #smbx ?
11:24 < snivy> well
11:24 <@JStoker> Yeah.
11:24 < snivy> i need you to get rid of my bouncer
11:24 <@JStoker> snivy, Well, we can't really do anything with it, as it'll reconnect (as you've discovered)
11:24 < snivy> it keeps reconnecting
11:24 < snivy> grrrr
11:24 < snivy> kline it
11:24 < snivy> anything
11:24 < snivy> get rid of it
11:24 <@JStoker> If you're trying to get the nick back, /ns release MichelFP
11:24 < snivy> :(
11:25 < snivy> okey good
11:25 < snivy> at least the bot wont take my nick anymore
11:25 <@JStoker> If I try to get rid of it, it'll just reconnect. I'd suggest turning it off at the bouncer itself, which will make it disconnect
11:25 < snivy> JStoker: the bouncer website is down
11:25 < snivy> i dont have access to the control panel
11:25 < snivy> nor the server
11:25 <@JStoker> I'd suggest taking that up with whoever owns the bouncer..?
11:35 < snivy> just changed all my passwords
11:35 < snivy> i dont trust spitfire anymore.
11:36 < Valtteri> so, like, Spitfire hosted a bouncer, Nightmare abused it on #smbx, Spitfire didn't do anything about it, and got fired
11:36 < snivy> yes
11:36 < Valtteri> way to go Nightmare
11:36 < snivy> the worst part is that spitfire didnt do anything against nightmare
11:36 < Valtteri> ikr
11:38 <@JStoker> Oh, and she's is still allowed on here. :-)

11:53 < Joey> spitfire also let nightmare bring a botnet into #smbx
11:56 < Snivy> joey thats what we were talking about
11:57 < Joey> ...oh
11:57 < Joey> that was yesterday though
11:57 < Joey> and bouncer != botnet
11:57 < Joey> er, two days ago
11:57 < Joey> no wait it WAS yesterdya
11:57 < Snivy> i was talking about how my bouncer was down due to the botnet attack
11:58 < Joey> Ahh.
11:58 < Joey> either way, i don't think firing spitfire was really the best option
11:58 < Snivy> the botnet attack resulted in spitfire being fired (because the botnet attack was coming from the bouncer)
11:59 < Snivy> spitfire being fired resulted in the cancellation of the bouncer
11:59 < Snivy> thats what i understood
11:59 < Joey> this is why i generally don't see a point in long distance internet relationships
12:00 < Joey> because if you think about it that's what this all comes to

16:46 < Nightmare> [12:35:54] <Valtteri> so, like, Spitfire hosted a bouncer, Nightmare abused it on #smbx, Spitfire didn't do anything about it, and got fired
16:46 < Nightmare> you guys are retards
16:46 < Nightmare> kthx
16:46 <@bikcmp> coming from his box
16:49 < Dan> quoting the IronDust rules, written by Spitfire himself
16:49 < Dan> We ask that users of the network do not spam or flood channels or users, and that they do not post inappropriate external links
16:50 < Valtteri> was Spitfire banned, too
16:50 < Valtteri> or why isn't he here
16:50 < Dan> and then he defends someone flooding multiple channels on multiple occasions, despite him being staff, and it being against the rules he wrote
16:50 < Dan> and the flood came from a box he owns too
16:50 < Dan> he's not banned, that I know of
16:51 <@bikcmp> Dan: why bother
16:51 <@bikcmp> and, no
16:51 <@bikcmp> spitfire is not banned
16:52 < Dan> but he wrote the rules, and as staff allowed and defended them being broken, and even provided the resources for them to be broken
16:52 < Nightmare> it's funny how you didn't ban me, the supposing offender, because it was so bad that I did what I did
16:52 < Nightmare> Also, you guys never did anything about it either
16:53 < Valtteri> they weren't online
16:53 < Dan> well the reason nothing was done, is because it would have affected the bnc users as well to ban the IP, no?
16:53 <@bikcmp> yes
16:53 <@bikcmp> exactly
16:54 <@bikcmp> we would be banning a irondust box
16:54 <@bikcmp> we can't do that.
16:54 <@bikcmp> well
16:54 < Nightmare> Then you culd have told Spitfire to tell me to stop using the bouncer.
16:54 < Nightmare> could*
16:54 <@bikcmp> Nightmare: i did!
16:54 <@bikcmp> Nightmare: "mmkay"
16:54 < Nightmare> No you did not.
16:54 < Dan> the flood was not done from the bouncer either
16:54 <@bikcmp> it was done from the box in which the bouncer was on
16:54 <@bikcmp> and you made it in such a way that to ban your bots i'd have to ban the bouncer
16:54 < Nightmare> bikcmp: It was done from 176.31.150.132
16:55 < Nightmare> [17:54:30] * [Nightmare] is connecting from *@149.255.104.57 149.255.104.57
16:55 < Nightmare> Derp.

16:55 <@bikcmp> 132.150.31.176.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer bouncer.irondust.net.
16:55 < Dan> there was also a flood from 149.255.104.57
16:55 < Nightmare> One time.
16:55 <@bikcmp> and there were floods from .57
16:55 <@bikcmp> yes
16:55 <@bikcmp> Nightmare: 3.
16:55 < Nightmare> k
16:55 < Dan> which is the new IP of the bouncers as well
16:55 <@bikcmp> your arguments are invalid, you are very lucky dan continues to put up with this type of abuse
16:55 < Nightmare> You guys are retarded.
16:56 <@bikcmp> frankly i'm very suprised dan still allows you to use that vps.
16:56 < Dan> bikcmp: wasn't my call
16:57 <@bikcmp> ah
16:57 < Nightmare> lol
16:57 < Nightmare> Wow.
16:57 < Dan> we have a policy which outlines all this stuff
16:57 <@bikcmp> Dan: and it didn't have anything about abuse coming from boxes?
16:57 < Nightmare> And you only made up the rules after I did such.
16:57 <@bikcmp> Nightmare: the ucp hasn't been touched since spitfire wrote it himself
16:57 < Dan> Nightmare: nope, that's the public policy
16:57 < Nightmare> "public policy"
16:58 < Nightmare> If you have some sort of private policy that people cannot read
16:58 < Dan> we have a policy for how to handle abuse for the staff, warnings, suspensions, and all
16:58 < Nightmare> You cannot expect them to follor such rules
16:58 < Dan> the private policy does not define the rules.
16:58 < Nightmare> And NOWHERE on the previous TOS did it say anything about what I did
16:58 < Dan> it defines the consequences
16:59 <@bikcmp> i don't get why we are arguing about this
16:59 < Nightmare> But it was not part of the rules.
16:59 <@bikcmp> if you want to continue your bickering do it in pm for god's sake
16:59 < Nightmare> Because what bikcmp did last night was completely retarded and unfair, to be quite honest.
16:59 < Dan> it was not allowed in the rules, nor was it forbidden. I thought people would have some common sense to not flood shit
17:00 < Dan> I guess I am just too nice.
17:00 <@bikcmp> Nightmare: please take it to pm with dan
17:00 < Dan> so I am now in the process of writing a very long TOS/AUP
17:00 < Nightmare> Why?
17:01 < Nightmare> To be quite frank, if you are going to continue to run your network like a dictator, I have no intention of staying here.
17:01 <@bikcmp> we aren't forcing you to stay
17:01 <@bikcmp> you're always free to leave.
17:02 < Nightmare> Yep, and IronDust's users will continue to trickle away anyway
17:02 < Nightmare> funny how that works

10:46 < Joey> JStoker, around?
10:46 <@JStoker> Of course! How can I help you, Joey? :D
10:46 < Joey> Do you code much in python?
10:47 <@JStoker> Not so much now, have done a significant amount though.
10:47 < Joey> K
10:47 < Joey> Well, I was trying to program my bot to write everything it receives to a file
10:48 <@JStoker> OK, neat
10:49 < Joey> ...except it doesn't
10:49 < Joey> So I was wondering if you could look at the code
10:49 <@JStoker> Ah.
10:49 < Joey> it's rather simple
10:49 <@JStoker> Sure, can do! :-)
10:49 < Joey> Thanks.
10:51 < Joey> http://pastebin.com/ddg27t09
10:52 <@JStoker> Aah. It just writes the last line received out to file?
10:53 <@JStoker> Actually, no, it wouldn't do that, it'd write the last of every second line out
10:53 < Joey> Er, it shouldn't do that, heh.
10:54 <@JStoker> First thing to do! You'll want to make it so that it only opens the file once, so that it doesn't keep writing the same block of lines in.
10:55 < Joey> Ah, that makes sense
10:55 <@JStoker> (as, open(..., 'w') goes and empties the file first, which I suspect isn't quite ideal :-))
10:55 <@JStoker> Second, would be to go something like results.write(line) just below the start of your for loop, so that it writes the line out to file.
10:55 < Andrio> I notice that there are two s.recv lines in there.
10:56 < Joey> Would I have to delete any code or just move it to the proper place?
10:57 <@JStoker> You'd have to remove the second recv, and move the other stuff to the right places
10:58 < Joey> Okay.
11:00 < Andrio> line=string.split(line)
11:00 < Andrio> what does that do?
11:01 < Andrio> nvm... I got it.
11:04 < Joey> JStoker, okay. Now it's giving me an error saying "text" is not defined, when I deleted the second s.recv
11:04 < Joey> which was text = s.recv(4096)
11:04 <@JStoker> You'll want to use line instead of text. :-)
11:04 < Andrio> line will be an array, won't it?
11:07 < Joey> results = open('ll.log', 'w')
11:07 < Joey> while 1:
11:07 < Joey>     READBUFFER = READBUFFER + s.recv(1024)
11:07 < Joey>     temp = string.split(READBUFFER, "\n")
11:07 < Joey>     READBUFFER = temp.pop()
11:07 < Joey>     for line in temp:
11:07 < Joey>         results.write(line)
11:07 < Joey>         line=string.rstrip(line)
11:07 < Joey>         line=string.split(line)
11:07 < Joey>         if(line[0]=="PING"):
11:07 < Joey>             s.send("PONG %s\r\n" % line[1])
11:07 < Joey>     print >>results, line
11:08 < Joey> Is that right?
11:10 < Andrio> Looks to me like  print >>results, line  should be in the for loop.
11:11 < Andrio> line being an array would mess things though.
11:12 < Andrio> I'd use a different variable for the array; that way the line variable is still there so you can log it.
11:13 < Joey> k
11:15 < Joey> Which instances of "line" should I change, Andrio?
11:17 < Andrio> The one to the left of the = in ' line=string.split(line) ' , and everything below that.
11:17 < Andrio> wait...
11:18 < Andrio> not everything below that, just the ones with the [ ] brackets.
11:19 < Joey> And then print >>results, text
11:19 < Joey> ?
11:19 < Andrio> No, still ' print >>results, line '
11:19 < Andrio> This way you aren't replacing line with an array.
11:20 < Joey> Ah, okay.
11:21 < Joey> Alright, it opens but it's not logging anything.
11:21 < Joey> Or connecting.
11:22 < Joey> http://pastebin.com/uE2wwtkb
11:26 <@JStoker> You don't need the print >>results ;-p
11:26 <@JStoker> (results.write(line)'ll do it perfectly fine)
11:26 < Joey> Okay.

11:32 < TheVoid> wtf is with their pings
11:32 < TheVoid> imo
11:33 <@JStoker> Ok, you need to put a newline in that, just go .write(line+'\n')
11:34 <@JStoker> I'd suggest also going and putting 'print line' near the results.write(line+'\n') line, so you can see the output on-screen too
11:34 <@JStoker> (And do you have print >> results anywhere too?)
11:35 < Andrio> Yeah, you're writing the line twice.
11:36 < Andrio> Get rid of line 41.
11:36 < Andrio> 42*
11:42 < Joey> So, put a newline and then in it put ".write(line+'\n')"?
11:43 < Andrio> Just the +'\n'
11:43 < Joey> oh
11:43 < Andrio> The s.send lines might need that too.
11:44 < Joey> Alright
11:45 < Joey> It's still giving me that error
11:46 < Joey> "You have not registered"
11:46 < Joey> http://pastebin.com/qUet59LT
11:49 < Andrio> I think it would be helpful to find out which s.send line is generating that error.
11:50 < Joey> the weird thing is that this worked before, the only thing i changed with the s.send lines is adding the newlines
11:51 < Joey> like, a few months ago when i made the original code it worked
11:51 < Joey> and it connected here and joined a channel just fine
11:52 < Andrio> What if you go back to that code?
11:52 < Joey> i tried it out today and about three weeks ago and it didn't work
11:53 < Joey> yet i didn't change anything
11:53 < Andrio> And the s.send lines don't need +'\n' or +'/n', that was my mistake.
11:54 < Joey> oh
11:54 < Joey> what about the last one with the PONG?
11:54 < Joey> does that need one?
11:54 < Andrio> There's a \n already in the
11:54 < Andrio> string.
11:54 < Joey> oh
11:54 < Andrio> You don't need to add another one.
11:54 < Joey> Okay, I deleted them
11:57 < Joey> Still giving me the same thing. :\
11:57 < Joey> I've never even seen "you have not registered" before
12:00 <@JStoker> It's because the next line you send is prefixed with '/n', which isn't a newline. (So, the message turns out to be '/nUSER', which the ircd doesn't accept)
12:01 <@JStoker> And, the s.send("PONG") line doesn't need the /n on the end either, as it already has one in the format

14:53 < Joey> so it gives me the errors...yet it continues?
14:53 <@JStoker> does it not connect? not log? not eat a pie?
14:53 < Joey> it always gave me "You are not registered"
14:53 < Joey> and now it did the same thing, yet continued
14:54 <@JStoker> no other errors?
14:54 <@JStoker> just after s.send("USER"), go s.flush()....Although that shouldn't be needed
14:54 < Joey> Well, now it isn't joining channels. :s
14:56 <@JStoker> Any errors?

14:57 <@JStoker> eh, remove it, can't remember what it is for sockets
14:59 < Joey> Alright, it connectss and is sitting on the network but doesn't join any channels.
15:03 <@JStoker> OK. Are there any errors from the ircd?
15:03 < Joey> Doesn't appear so.
15:03 <@JStoker> Put a print statement in the joins channel loop, printing out the name of the channel?
15:04 <@JStoker> Ah.
15:04 <@JStoker> Yeah, it's going and going across each of the characters in CHANNELS
15:04 <@JStoker> You'll want to make that a list, so that it's going across each channel, not the characters

15:29 <@bikcmp> Joey: point?
15:30 <@JStoker> Oh crap, that's still up isn't it
15:30 <@bikcmp> Joey: leave it
15:30 <@bikcmp> JStoker: leave it!
15:31 <@JStoker> Eh, why?
15:31 <@bikcmp> JStoker: it actually helped me a bit.
15:31 <@bikcmp> lol
15:31 <@JStoker> for one, nobody uses it, and for two, nobody should use it
15:31 <@bikcmp> you know, gatekeeper v1 days
15:31 <@bikcmp> :-P
15:31 <@bikcmp> when i had no idea what .split did
15:35 < Joey> bikcmp: my problem is that the bot doesn't join any channels
15:35 <@bikcmp> Joey: yes
15:35 < Joey> and that's the code that you gave me, that worked in the past
15:36 <@bikcmp> Joey: that's bcause of the socket freakyness
15:36 < Joey> what's so freaky about it
15:36 <@bikcmp> actually
15:36 <@bikcmp> Joey: know if esper does pingcookies?
15:36 <@JStoker> yep
15:36 <@bikcmp> that's why ;p
15:36 <@JStoker> does deal with it though
15:36  * bikcmp shivers.
15:37 < Joey> what is a pingcookie
15:37 <@JStoker> unless it just dumps the messages you send before the cookie... perhaps..
15:37 <@JStoker> Joey, did it work originally?
15:37 < Joey> it worked on IronDust
15:37 <@JStoker> has it ever worked on esper?
15:38 < Joey> Not to my knowledge
15:39 < Joey> What is a pingcookie?
15:39 <@JStoker> They ask you to reply to a ping before fully connecting you to the network.
15:39 < Joey> oh
15:39 <@JStoker> It helps with quite a lot of badly coded bots, malicious traffic, and other silly things.
15:41 < Joey> FIXED IT
15:41 < Joey> placed the joining channel in the while loop
15:41 < Joey> i know that's probably bad to do
15:41 < Joey> but eh
15:43 < Nano> Are you writing a bot?
15:43 < Nano> ah, okay I see.
15:44 <@JStoker> Joey, make it do the join on seeing a 001 message, that'd be better
15:44 <@JStoker> (where the second word is '001')
15:56 < Joey> bikcmp: is there a way i can parse the bots output into something diferent
15:56 < Joey> ff
15:56 <@bikcmp> Joey: output?
15:57 < Joey> yeah
15:57 < Joey> output to the file
15:57 < Joey> can i change the way it presents that
15:57 <@bikcmp> i'm really confused
15:57 <@bikcmp> what do you want to do
15:57 < Joey> k
15:58 < Joey> It outputs this to a file: :Chuck_Quizmo!~Chuck_Qui@naos.dreamhost.com NOTICE LLStats :Welcome to #LemmysLand, LLStats!
15:58 <@bikcmp> ok
15:58 <@bikcmp> Joey: and what do you want to do with that
15:58 < Joey> I want it to output this: -Chuck_Quizmo- Welcome to #LemmysLand, LLStats!
15:59 <@bikcmp> ok

16:05 <@bikcmp> that'll work. ;p
16:05 <@bikcmp> -Chuck_Quizmo- XYZ
16:06 <@JStoker> i think he also wants it to check that it's a notice
16:06 <@JStoker> and wait, isn't line already split up?
16:06 <@JStoker> yep, it is, text
16:06 <@JStoker> s/line.split(" ")/text/
16:07 <@bikcmp> lol
16:11 < Joey> bikcmp: parsing all PRIVMSGs to the channel would be good too
16:12 < Joey> i should've specified sorry
16:12 < Joey> that's really what i was getting at
16:12 <@bikcmp> eh?
16:12 <@bikcmp> you only want privmsgs?
16:12 <@bikcmp> ok

16:19 < Joey> JStoker: PISG will do that
16:19 <@JStoker> Joey, uh, not if you remove out the data on which type of message it is
16:19 < Joey> bikcmp: privmsgs to channels should look like <user> hi
16:20 < Joey> if i have it set on a certain type of data it will ignore anything in the log file that doesn't match it

00:55 <@bikcmp> na.irc ;p
00:55 < Andro-Cyc> bikcmp: yes I realized that
00:55 < quantibility> Jstoker, nope plain ol mirc
00:55 < quantibility> why?
00:55 <@bikcmp> sounds like a weird thing
00:56 < Andro-Cyc> No but my settings were just irc.irondust.net
00:56 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: are you able to reproduce it?
00:56 < Andro-Cyc> I dunno it will be cached for 10 min by android OS so I can try leaving and coming back in awhile
00:57 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: i doubt that this is a reproducable issue- it sounds like your isp derped
00:57 < Andro-Cyc> bikcmp: on another note update your security keys to match and be valid
00:57 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: ssl?
00:57 <@bikcmp> we don't have our keys signed by a CA
00:57 <@bikcmp> well
00:57 <@bikcmp> they're signed by the irondust CA
00:57 < Andro-Cyc> bikcmp: no I have everything else flawless
00:57 <@bikcmp> which isn't trusted by anything
00:57 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: ?
00:57 < Andro-Cyc> And I use Google's dns
00:58 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: it sounds like it was just a weird issue
00:58 < quantibility> did i get chat lost?
00:58 < Andro-Cyc> bikcmp: I know they are self signed but it would be nice if all the servers had matching self signed keys that aren't expired
00:59 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: that wouldn't work
00:59 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: they're all signed by the irondust ca
00:59 <@bikcmp> there is a root cert you can trust
01:00 < Andro-Cyc> Yes but if they matched and were valid to irondust CA I could add as trusted root
01:01 < Andro-Cyc> The problem is some are expired or don't match or are signed differently
01:01  * JStoker suggests adding a real certificate to them, heh
01:01 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: yeah
01:01 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: just trust invalid certs, imo
01:01 < Andro-Cyc> JStoker: that would cost money and bikcmp is cheap
01:02 <@bikcmp> unless you want to buy it
01:02 <@bikcmp> yeah
01:02 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: pay up bud
01:02 <@bikcmp> <.<
01:02 < Andro-Cyc> bikcmp: it was JStoker suggestion not mine
01:02 <@JStoker> :-p
01:02 < Andro-Cyc> :)
01:02 < quantibility> screw it
01:03 < Andro-Cyc> bikcmp: make them match from server to server
01:03 < quantibility> ill just open command and find the file by hand then ill run it through there
01:03 < Andro-Cyc> Self signed is fine but expired and mismatch ing is just awful
01:03 <@bikcmp> Andro-Cyc: uh
01:03 <@bikcmp> that'd pretty much make it even less secure
01:04 <@JStoker> Andro-Cyc, Only problem with doing that, is if someone breaks into one of our boxes and steals the certificates, well, we're screwed! :-)
01:04 < Andro-Cyc> No I mean the certificate authority you are using varies by server
01:04 <@JStoker> Well, I didn't do it. :-P
01:04 <@bikcmp> they should all be 'irondust primary public certification authority'
01:04 <@bikcmp> second
01:04  * JStoker builds a pretty neon sign pointing to bikcmp
01:05 < Andro-Cyc> You can have different keys for each server in the same store
01:05 < Andro-Cyc> JStoker: give him money to get real keys
01:05 < Andro-Cyc> Problem solved
01:05 <@JStoker> Andro-Cyc, Bah, don't particularly have much money myself
01:06 < Andro-Cyc> Okay then take bikcmp's money when he isn't looking and then use that for the certs
01:06 <@JStoker> k, will do
01:06 <@bikcmp> Server certificate

14:20 <@alyx> also, this netsplit someone was talking about earlier
14:20 <@alyx> did it ever stop being split
14:22 < Joey> no, it didn't
14:22 < Joey> that's what worries me
14:22 < Joey> because JStoker and bikcmp were both on it

14:24 <@alyx> are both AWOL.
14:24 <@alyx> and some channel is getting botnetted, and apparently has been for like, an hour.
14:25 <@alyx> AND the network is split.
14:28 < Joey> every active channel got botnetted
14:28 <@alyx> ...
14:28 < Joey> i had to make a seperate channel just for #knuxcentral
14:29 <@alyx> well...
14:29 <@alyx> at least we have services |"

15:19 < Valtteri|Terraria> there were like 50 of them
15:20 < Valtteri|Terraria> and then they masspinged everyone
15:20 < Valtteri|Terraria> spammed everyone's query
15:20 < Valtteri|Terraria> changed nicks
15:21 < Valtteri|Terraria> we had to forward users to another channel and then invite them
15:21 < Ragont> <Valtteri|Terraria> there were like 50 of them
15:21 < Ragont> more like 100+
15:21 < Valtteri|Terraria> actually
15:21 < Valtteri|Terraria> 200 of them joined #knuxcentral
15:21 < Ragont> we went from ~20 users to ~200
15:21 < Ragont> yeah
15:22 < Valtteri|Terraria> we had to set a user limit
15:22 < Valtteri|Terraria> bikcmp: do you need more logs

20:37 < Arle> My registration seems to have broken.
20:37 < Joey> oh
20:37 < Joey> yeah that makes sense
20:37 < Arle> Why is this?
20:37 < Joey> something happened with a database today
20:37 < Joey> it reverted to an old one if i remember correctly
20:37 < Arle> ok, so I will need to reregister, then?
20:37 < Joey> I think that would be a practical decision at the moment
20:38 < Arle> Well, thanks for letting me know.
20:38 < Arle> (This should probably go in the topic.)
21:00 < Dan> Arle: let me check
21:01 < Dan> the nickname Arle is not registered. this can either be due to database problems(which I heard may have occured), or due to not identifying to your nick for a long period of time
21:01 < Arle> Actually, my account is named Andrio.
21:01 < Arle> and when I tried to register, it said that 'Andrio is not a registered nickname.'
21:02 < Arle> even though it was yesterday.
21:02 < Dan> I can see that you re-registered your nick about 15 minutes ago
21:02 < Arle> yeah
21:03 < Arle> Should I not have done that?
21:04 < Dan> it's fine.
21:04 < Dan> I'd recommend that as the solution actually
21:04 < Arle> :)
21:05 < Dan> for now
21:09 < Arle> for now?
21:11 <@bikcmp> Arle: how long ago did you register?
21:12 < Arle> I registered my nickname Andrio on 5 July
21:13 <@bikcmp> hm.
21:13 < Arle> I registered it again about 30 mins ago because it broke.
21:13 <@bikcmp> that's really weird.
21:13 < Arle> Didn't have any problems with the second registration though...

19:30 < huru> Hi Joey.
19:30 < Joey> hiys
19:30 < Joey> hiya
19:30 < huru> pretty much, bikcmp has stepped down to work on future projects, but he's remaining on the staff team.
19:30 < huru> I am just taking over the management side of it all.
19:31 < huru> So the network isn't going to really change 'appearence wise' just a transfer of servers. ;)
19:31 < huru> anything else you'd like to know?
19:31 < Joey> yeah, what kind of server transfering are we talking about here?
19:32 < Shabbypenguin> they are all going to be moved to my .xxpg domains
19:32 < Shabbypenguin> >.>
19:32 < huru> well i'll be bringing in a new server (us node) along with our uk node
19:32 < huru> and hopefully look into an asian pacific server
19:33 < huru> for worldwide coverage.
19:34 < Joey> are the current servers staying? and if not, which ones currently used will we lose?

12:20 <@JStoker> HAHAHA, OK. Just wanted to check, as far as I was aware it still worked. I think that might be something bikcmp or horough should solve when they have some time (or at least stop announcing it in the message!)
12:20 < Nightmare> Or disable Xanos
12:20 < XXCoder> K lined? isnt some of them new admins?
12:20 < Nightmare> 99.99% of what it picks up is false positive
12:21 <@JStoker> Nightmare, If it was up to me, I'dve reintroduced EvilJStoker, but..
12:21 <@JStoker> Nightmare, I'd highly suggest nagging at bikcmp a bit until he reduces the sensitivity, perhaps? :-)
12:21 < Nightmare> JStoker: It already doesn't pick up people that actually are spamming
12:22 < Nightmare> It's just really messed up, in my opinion
12:22 < Nightmare> I'm not familiar with EvilJStoker so I can't comment much on that.
12:22 <@JStoker> Nobody has any idea where xanos did it, do they... Heh. :-p
12:22 <@JStoker> Nightmare, Hehe. I think there were about 6 false positives (all fixed within a hour or so of me noticing) in the entire lifetime... But that's beside the point.

12:36 < Valtteri> yes
12:38 <@JStoker> If I had my way, I'd just not bother with antispam bots... But that isn't terribly usable, after some... person... decides to spam to annoy everyone...

12:38 < Knux> just remove it

12:42 < Valtteri> sounds fun

12:47 <@JStoker> Indeed. If I did it anyway, I can almost guarantee I would be very quickly destaffed, and then it'll probably come back anyway.
12:47 < Nightmare> ^
12:47 <@JStoker> I know. I'm on your side with this (or, for the most part). I'd expect bikcmp could 'tune' it down a bit, or something..
12:47 < Nightmare> If it was JStoker's decision I really don't think he'd have a problem at all with removing the shit bot
12:47 < Nightmare> Yep
12:48 <@JStoker> If it was my decision, we'd not have any form of automated spamfiltering (Email, IRC, Whatever) (or for that matter, flood controls)... But, sadly the 'big wide world' isn't very nice to people. :-(

15:59 <@huru> Hi, I have quite a good history of running IRC network.
15:59 <@huru> lol.
15:59 < Tarlach> Heh, TrinityFlash, You're one to talk, I haven't heard from you for ages until recently.
16:00 < Joey> huru: do you hang out on staticbox at all
16:00 <@huru> Joey: not as of recent.
16:00 <@huru> I only really go there to do deals with nenolod.
16:00 < Joey> ah
16:01 < Joey> huru: you didn't /buy/ irondust, did you
16:01 < Tarlach> Word is that he did.
16:01 < Joey> i know you're switching some servers around and stuff and that generally can involve money
16:02 < Tarlach> Joey, I've heard from 2 people that it sold for ballpark 150-200$
16:02 < Tarlach> No conformation on that though.
16:02 <@huru> Woah, apparently I am rich o:
16:02 < Joey> Tarlach: i would doubt that
16:02 < Tarlach> Joey, Spitfire is inclined to agree with you.

18:28 < Nightmare> I renamed the folder because I was screenshotting my desktop

12:49 <@bikcmp> yeah
12:49 <@bikcmp> TheVoid-: that's also happened to someone i know
12:49 < TheVoid-> i was suprised
12:49 <@bikcmp> he's going to college
12:49 <@bikcmp> he was caught with a bit of weed

12:51 < Ricki> I know some dude who passed out with 2 gram of MDMA in a street, woke up in a police van, they let him off though, surprisingly
12:51 <@bikcmp> mdma, hm
12:51 <@bikcmp> what's mdma
12:51 < Ricki> class A
12:51 < Ricki> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA
12:51 <@bikcmp> oh
12:51 <@bikcmp> Ricki: yeah
12:51 <@bikcmp> just saw
12:51 <@bikcmp> ecstasy is the phrase they use here
12:51 <@bikcmp> never heard of mdma
12:52 < Ricki> Well, mdma is usually sold in powder/crystal form, thats the main substance in ectasy pills, however ectasy pills contain usually a lot of other different substances
12:52 <@bikcmp> yeah
12:52 < Ricki> Often cut with anything, from small amounts of coke, to stuff like meth and caffene and pressed into a pill.
12:53 < TheVoid-> heh
12:53 < TheVoid-> it's called meth here
12:53 < Ricki> MDMA isnt meth
12:53 < TheVoid-> oh
12:53 < Ricki> Chemically similar, but they are different drugs
12:53 < Ricki> Different effects etc
12:53 < Ricki> Plus meth is highly addictive, mdma isnt really addictive at all I found.
12:53 <@bikcmp> meth?
12:53 < Ricki> crystal meth?
12:53 <@bikcmp> didn't realize it was addictigve
12:53 <@bikcmp> oh
12:53 <@bikcmp> no
12:54 <@bikcmp> misread
12:54 < Ricki> Yeah, pretty dangerous drug, I have a good friend who was addicted to smoking heroin, then moved onto crystal meth, nearly destroyed her life, clean now though.
12:58 < TheVoid-> caffeine is my favourite drug

07:35 < Nano> Goodmorning.
07:35 < Nano> Is there a way to get irc to not mask my host since i'm using a bouncer?
07:36 < Nano> I'd really enjoy it if it were possible for it to say mmoempire.net instead of yrfyhmokc.net
07:36 < Nano> or in general for irondust to not mask mmoempire.net
07:36 < Andrio> Remove your user mode +x
07:37 < Nano> Oh, thanks. Figures it's something on my end :P

17:48 < TheVoid> kana is simple
17:48 < TheVoid> kanji is the bitch you have to learn
17:48 < TheVoid> because there's like
17:48 < TheVoid> tons of it
17:48 < TheVoid> like thousands or some shit
17:49 < michelfp> thousands?
17:49 < gry> well they're saying some part of japanese doesn't have an alphabet
17:49 < TheVoid> i don't think you learn them all O_O
17:49 < gry> like chinese
17:49 < TheVoid> lol
17:49 < TheVoid> yes
17:49 < TheVoid> it#s basically chinese
17:50 < gry> it's fine to learn if you have the time and something that talks and writes a lot near you, such as the internet
17:52 < michelfp> i dont understand how japanese grammar works
17:52 < michelfp> is it the same way english works
17:52 < michelfp> as in
17:52 < michelfp> the positioning

18:01 < TheVoid> i wonder how fucked japanese keyboards are like
18:01  * TheVoid google images
18:01 < michelfp> thevoid they use a keyboard like ours
18:01 < michelfp> and type hiragana/katakana/kanji by using the keyboard layout config in windows

18:02 < TheVoid> O_o
18:02 < michelfp> TheVoid: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/59319743/Sem%20t%C3%ADtulo.png
18:02 < michelfp> and
18:02 < michelfp> if they wanted to type 
18:02 < michelfp> they'd type "michieru" normally
18:02 < michelfp> lol
18:03 < TheVoid> ahhh
18:03 < TheVoid> so they need to err
18:03 < TheVoid> learn romaji
18:03 < TheVoid> to type
18:03 < michelfp> ofc
18:03 < TheVoid> then it auto-puts it?
18:03 < michelfp> >.>
18:03 < TheVoid> heh

18:05 < michelfp> i should consider learning another language but it seems to be a pita
18:06 < TheVoid> japanese is just
18:06 < TheVoid> you need to learn the alphabet
18:06 < TheVoid> the kanji
18:06 < TheVoid> the words in hira/kata
18:06 < TheVoid> or just kana
18:06 < TheVoid> lol
18:06 < michelfp> i think each word is a character
18:06 < michelfp> like
18:06 < michelfp> car has it's own character
18:06 < michelfp> or cow
18:06 < michelfp> or computer
18:06 < TheVoid> yes that would be kanji lol
18:06 < michelfp> doesn't it
18:07 < michelfp> can they mix kanji with other alphabets
18:07 < TheVoid> yes
18:07 < TheVoid> i've seen it
18:07 < TheVoid> lol
18:08 < TheVoid> i guess you can just use kana (short word for hiragama and katakana combined) if you don't know the kanji for it

01:30 < ErikMouse> Okay, anyone know what the hell happened? It seemed both irc.irondust.net and irc.fossnet.info weren't working like port 6667 was closed, and I couldn't connect to lithium, quicksilver, or zinc either.
01:31 <@huru> ErikMouse: networking issue
01:31 <@huru> everything went kaput
01:31 <@huru> and zinc is no more, due to the fact it was getting too heavily ddos'ed.
01:34 < ErikMouse> And I found myself ended up on KottNet for a bit when trying to reconnect to something, and that might be because FOSSnet used to be a part of Kottnet before IronDust was created.
01:35 < ErikMouse> Which is odd and not sure what caused me to be routed over to there.
01:36 <@huru> interesting
01:36 <@huru> anyways my apologies about the downtime.
01:36 <@huru> dan & i got it back up as quick as we could.
01:38 <@Dan> if anyone would like to prevent this from happening in the future, and has coding knowledge, and knowledge of KVM, let me know. we need a new control panel

15:53 <@bikcmp> no, linode just requires a credit card and doesn't accept paypal for that reason
15:53 <@bikcmp> nvm
15:53 <@bikcmp> yeah
15:53 <@bikcmp> Dan: they don't take paypal because of that, i just looked
15:53 < Dan> and they get hot cards from time to time.
15:53 <@bikcmp> hot cards?
15:54 < Dan> stolen CCs
15:54 <@bikcmp> yeah
15:54 <@bikcmp> Dan: but.
15:54 <@bikcmp> they have a cc.
15:54 <@bikcmp> ie, it's traceable.
15:54 <@bikcmp> it has a paper trail.
15:54 < Dan> you know how much shit they have to deal with when someone uses a hot card?
15:55 < Dan> they run a CC without checking a person's ID against the card info, so they become at fault
15:55 < Dan> just like a store
15:55 < Dan> when I worked in retail, we always IDed.

14:56 <@huru> derp: ever considered I work 50+ hours a week, to support my poor family?
14:56 < Vijfhoek> Good opers should never feel like mass k-lining when pushed into a corner
14:56 <@bikcmp> Harold: but, the thing to note is that irc is a free media means that you can say whatever you want in regards to 'we do not censor stuff before it is said'
14:56 <@bikcmp> Harold: we just send it, instantly
14:56 < michelfp> huru: if you're that busy with your work, you should hand the irc to someone who can dedicate their time more than you
14:56 < derp> huru: offcourse.
14:56 <@huru> michelfp: and I have
14:56 < TheVoid> stop caring for irc and buying networks so much and support your family
14:57 < TheVoid> imo
14:57 < derp> ^
14:57 < Vijfhoek> huru: and what does that have to do with banning channels?

14:58 < Marketh> I don't know why you are making them out to be bad guys for klining people for this idiocy
14:58 < Marketh> I mean what do you expect, with the way you are acting infront of them
14:58 < Vijfhoek> michel did nothing wrong
14:58 < derp> ^
14:58 < Marketh> Perhaps not in this channel
14:59 < Marketh> you can't spy on every single action michelfp does on this network
14:59 < Vijfhoek> and why k-line for something channel specific
14:59 <@Joah> hi
14:59 < Marketh> but how do you know if it iwas channel specific
14:59 < Marketh> you have no idea why he was klined to begin with
14:59 <@huru> How do you know it was channel specific?
14:59 < Marketh> you are making assumptions and making them out to be the bad guy
14:59 <@Joah> michelfp attempted to log into huru's nickserv account
14:59 <@Joah> multiple times
14:59 <@huru> He was attempting to hack into accounts
14:59 < derp> So?
14:59 < Marketh> there you go
14:59 <@Joah> then he evaded his ban
14:59 < Superuser> ok
14:59 < derp> He failed so nothing to worry about.
14:59 < Vijfhoek> so, what does that mean?
14:59 < Vijfhoek> like...
15:00 < derp> he dooes not harm anyone.
15:00 < derp> its a nice kid
15:00 < Vijfhoek> a good oper password shouldn't be hackable anyway
15:00 <@huru> and it isn't
15:00 <@huru> but thats besides the point.
15:00 < Vijfhoek> well then why worry
15:00 < Marketh> derp, you get arrested for attempted murder even if you don't manage to murder anyone
15:00 < derp> and should be atleast 50char longs.
15:00 < TheVoid> <huru> He was attempting to hack into accounts
15:00 < TheVoid> one mere ghos
15:00 < TheVoid> t
15:00 < derp> This is not real life guys...
15:00 < TheVoid> using the pass "dicks"
15:00 < derp> this is IRC.
15:00 < Marketh> says the person making this out to be a big deal
15:01 < derp> :D
15:01 < Marketh> if it's "just irc" then stop making such a big issue about things
15:01 <@Joah> Marketh is completely right
15:01 < derp> ok
15:01 < derp> good for him
15:01  * derp claps
15:01 < Zevenhoek> but we want our channel back
15:01 < Superuser> yes
15:01 < derp> yes
15:01 < Saku> I agree with Joah
15:01 < Achthoek> Give it back!
15:01 < Zevenhoek> we didn't hurt anyone with the channel, now did we?

15:14 <@huru> and what joah said
15:14 < ifeelspiedupon> why do you care
15:14 < TheVoid> ^
15:14 < Superuser> ^^
15:14 <@Joah> this network isn't a trollfest. users acting immature will be dealt with accordingly
15:14 <@huru> Thats like asking me asking you why are you acting like trolls?
15:15 <@huru> you'll never give me a straight answer.
15:15 < ifeelspiedupon> I am not trolling anyone
15:15 < ifeelspiedupon> I am standing up for my freedom
15:15 <@huru> ^
15:15 <@huru> exactly my point
15:15 <@huru> no straight answer
15:15 < Marketh> Joah, didn't you say before that you were OK with the channel name before
15:15 < ifeelspiedupon> How is that not an answer
15:15 <@Joah> i said i had no issue with it, however, other management does
15:15 < Marketh> Fair enough
15:15 <@Joah> i was presented with a good argument on why it shouldn't be allowed
15:15 < ifeelspiedupon> So everyone in the french revolution were trolls?
15:16 < ifeelspiedupon> Cool vision
15:16 < ifeelspiedupon> might've made history somewhat interesting
15:16 <@Joah> yes, because that's entirely relevant
15:17 < ifeelspiedupon> just mspaint all the images
15:17 < ifeelspiedupon> and put trollfaces over every frenchman
15:17 < ifeelspiedupon> would be fun
15:17 <@Dan> funnily enough, after being told about the new management policy, I support it
15:18 < ifeelspiedupon> In Internet slang, a troll is someone who posts inflammatory,[2] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as a forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response[3] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.[4]
15:18 < ifeelspiedupon> I do not have the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response

22:34 < Ignoritus> Joah: I heard Magus was banned from here.
22:34 < Ignoritus> Out of curiosity, do you have logs?
22:35 <@Joah> no, and he's no longer banned
22:35 < Ignoritus> Another channel is saying that he clearly wasn't trolling, but I know he has a history of trolling and I prefer to form an opinion myself.
22:36 <@Joah> Ignoritus: pretty much he said he came here because he heard he could get banned easily
22:36 <@Joah> then he proceeded to point out he's violating rules
22:36 < Ignoritus> Sounds like something he'd do.
22:36 < Ignoritus> #knuxcentral is leaving because of the stricter rules.
22:36 < Ignoritus> I lost most of my faith in that community because of it.
22:36 < Ignoritus> I knew they were real idiots in the chat.
22:37 < Ignoritus> But leaving because they can't act like a group of retarded 9 year olds anymore?

11:58 < deadfish> Joah, Sakke got once banned from this channel
11:58 < deadfish> could you unban him pleae?

12:00 < Knux> <deadfish> I just saw Knux in that image
12:00 < Knux> <deadfish> you think that I'm racist, I think you are satan
12:00 < Knux> <deadfish> Well, you do harass me

12:00 < Knux> <Knux> How?

12:00 < Knux> <deadfish> [19:39] <Knux> How?
12:00 < Knux> <deadfish> ban from the forums for no reason
12:00 < Knux> <Knux> that's not harrasment
12:00 < Knux> <Knux> you stupid fuck

12:00 < Knux> <Knux> now leave me alone

12:00 < Knux> <deadfish> and that comic wasn't so racist.. it didn't insult anyone seriously
12:01 < Knux>  
12:01 <@Joah> i suggest you both use /ignore on each other
12:01 < deadfish> that must be good idea
12:01 < Valtteri> lol
12:01 < deadfish> but I'm not the one who started this
12:02 < Knux> yes, you are
12:02 < deadfish> how I did start it Knux?
12:03 < Knux> by you sending me racist comics
12:03 < deadfish> they don't insult anyone seriously
12:03 < deadfish> and everyone else does like them
12:03 < deadfish> adn you would've said that you don't want them
12:04 < deadfish> instead of banning me from everywhere
12:09 < deadfish> Knux, I don't have anything against you
12:09 < deadfish> But why you do?
12:11 < deadfish> anyway
12:11 < deadfish> [19:59] <@Joah> deadfish: why?

12:18 < deadfish> anyway, Sakke, do you understand why Knux hates me?
12:18 < Sakke> not really
12:19 < deadfish> I've been thinking about that
12:19 < deadfish> he bans me for no reason form forums and calls me racist cunt and wants me to get k-lined
12:20 < deadfish> I can't understand it
12:20 < deadfish> So, i realized only this image http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/3/36/Lucifer.JPG

11:06 < Cosy> set flags +AOiortv ? I did AOP...
11:09 <@Joah> ?
11:09 < Cosy> I did the command to give someone automatic OP, and it gave them the above flag is that right?
11:09 < Cosy> seems strange :P
11:09 <@Joah> those are correct for AOP
11:10 < Cosy> Ahh ok thanks :P
11:10 < Cosy> I am really rusty at IRC >_<
11:10 < Cosy> What is the command for reconnect?
11:12 < Cosy> Just a quick question regarding channel safety
11:12 < Cosy> If I gave OP to someone and they were a douche
11:12 < Cosy> They deop'd me and every time I joined they kicked me
11:12 < Cosy> How would I 'fight' against that?
11:17 <@Joah> remove their flags
11:17 <@Joah> /cs flags #channel nick -*
11:17 <@Joah> also, the reconnect command depends on your client
11:17 <@Joah> for (He)XChat, it's `/reconnect`
11:17 < Cosy> Oh so I could control cs even if I am not in the channel?
11:17 <@Joah> yes
11:18 < Cosy> Oh that is neat, thanks
11:18 <@Joah> np

23:00 <@bikcmp> no checks, no debit card, nothing
23:00 <@bikcmp> nothing but 'put money in and never see it again until you turn 18'

14:41 < Knux> Kuulit.
14:42 < lu9> This interesting position is not really a game  it is something better. Mario Worker is a toolset, which lets you create Mario games yourself! Now you can design your own Mario game even without possessing expert programming knowledge  just download Mario Worker and begin your creation! Build complete levels from the blocks, as if you were playing with bricks  it really is so easy! Place Koopa monsters wherever you wish, drag and drop coins to put them on
14:42 < lu9>  leading to another locations, music and sound effects just by clicking on them... Making a game has never been so easy! Is Super Mario Bros too hard for you? Or maybe it is too easy? Now you can make your favourite game as difficult, as you want! Enemies, bonuses, coins, secret locations  it is all up to you where and how many of them the player will encounter. Make your own game and test it yourself, then show it to your friends to enjoy! Now you are the mast

06:55 < Jasmine> not on EsperNet
06:55 < Jasmine> Can you think why that might be?
06:58 < gry> sounds like one of these networks has an auto-away setting disabled
06:59 < gry> http://www.icechat.net/site/help/icechat-options/ has a description of the away system
07:02 < gry> if you have a window like this http://i1034.photobucket.com/albums/a425/Skaven71/Food/13.png what are the advanced settings in it?
07:05 < Jasmine> That looks like a different version of IceChat

07:06 < gry> I wouldn't be able to help too well as I don't have it on this box and don't remember what the settings window looks like

14:10 < Marketh> hi, Sakke keeps ban evading (I've lost count now), if somebody could do something about this I would be v. happy
14:11 < Sakke> I can do something about that I think
14:11 -!- Knuckles96 is now known as Valtteri
14:11 < Marketh> I don't care if you can
14:11 < Sakke> :(
14:11 < Marketh> you've done it well over 5 times now
14:11 < Marketh> Staff should be doing something by now
14:11 < Marketh> because it's getting old
14:12 < Sakke> when I'm at different places the ip is different and the channel is on my autojoin
14:12 < Sakke> I'll just take it off and problem solved
14:12 < Sakke> I won't bother you anymore
14:12 < Marketh> sorry but it's too late for this
14:12 < Marketh> you already knew this a long time ago and knew that you were supposed to be banned
14:13 < Marketh> doing it by "accident" just isn't a good enough excuse after having ban evaded that way multiple times already
14:13 < Marketh> I want something done about it
14:19 < Sakke> okay, Marketh, I fixed it now
14:20 < Sakke> I'll remove it from my autojoin on my laptop too and I won't be a problem
14:20 < Marketh> Again, it's too late for that. You've knowingly evaded that ban from that channel far too many times. It's a bit late to get scared now that I've decided to go to network staff about it
14:21 < Marketh> [19:23:41] <Sakke> I'm actually supposed to be banned lol

16:03 <@Jester> Marketh, give him one more time. I've seen him say now that he's removed autojoin from everything, if he joins once more then you can ping/pm one of the staff and it'll be solved.
16:03 <@bikcmp> Marketh: no, i'm dead serious
16:03 < Marketh> Jester, you do not understand, he's been doing it for months and months by "accident". He knew full well that he was supposed to be banned, and every time I find out he's evaded it he's usually doing something stupid against the channel rules deserving of another ban (along with the fact he evaded the previous ban anyway)
16:04 <@Jester> manof69: o: Whut whut, maybe Jester?
16:04 < Marketh> This has gone far beyond "one more chance"
16:04 <@bikcmp> Marketh: i don't quite understand what's going on
16:04 < Marketh> bikcmp, it's about Sakke ban evading #terraria like several times a week
16:04 < Marketh> he knows 100% he is meant to be banned but keeps "accidentally" ban evading
16:04 <@bikcmp> oh

06:06 < gry> Valtteri, hi
06:06 < gry> Valtteri, mode #channel +I $a:account <-- should work for you if the channel doesn't empty
06:07 < Valtteri> i tried that
06:07 < gry> Valtteri, if it does get empty you might want to set guard on (/msg chanserv help set guard)
06:07 < gry> how well did it work? what did you see?
06:07 < Valtteri> hold on
06:08 < gry> if you set guard on, chanserv joins and sticks around, so channel doesn't empty and modes don't get reset
06:08 < Valtteri> * Valtteri sets invite on account $a:MasterBTB.
06:08 < Nightmare> Or you can also set invites with ChanServ I believe
06:08 < Nightmare> /cs flags accountname +i
06:09 < gry> then folk would have to '/cs invite' self each time, while +I means they can Just Join
06:09 < Valtteri> -ChanServ- The GUARD flag is already set for channel #TAOK.
06:09 < gry> +I  $a:MasterBTB sounds like something that would work properly, it's just the folk who would have to identify to nickserv before joining
06:10 < Valtteri> well it keeps disappearing
06:10 < gry> disappearing? does it disappear at once or sometimes?
06:10 < Valtteri> i need to set it again everyday
06:11 < gry> it means a) channel gets empty or b) another bot or op unsets it
06:12 < gry> do you idle in the channel twenty hour hours daily?
06:12 < gry> s/h/f/
06:17 < Valtteri> no i don't
06:17 < Valtteri> I don't know how long it takes for the invite to fade out actually
06:18 < gry> it doesn't fade out on its own until one of these (A) and (B) things happen
06:18 < Valtteri> I think I've had to set it again on them every time they've rejoined
06:18 < gry> that's not how invite exceptions work
06:18 < Valtteri> yeah i know
06:18 < Valtteri> we should try it out
06:18 < gry> and you have to be opped in a channel to see +I mode changes
06:19 < Valtteri> let's do a test
06:19 < Valtteri> i set an invite on you
06:19 < Valtteri> then you leave
06:19 < Valtteri> and try to rejoin
06:19 < gry> sure
06:19 < Valtteri> on #taok
06:20 < gry> it appears to have actually worked
06:20 < Valtteri> yeah
06:20 < Valtteri> but why do i need to reset it so often
06:23 < gry> that's odd, i'll idle in there for a bit
06:55 < Nightmare> [07:06:53] <gry> then folk would have to '/cs invite' self each time, while +I means they can Just Join
06:56 < Nightmare> indeed but it's better than nothing

14:49 < MasterBTB> I didnt spam you
14:49 < MasterBTB> You fucking prick
14:50 < Spitfire> If you're being spammed, either set ignores or change your umode.
14:50 < Nightmare> Joey: This is not network wide abuse so why does it deserve a k-line other than you just wanting to be stupid
14:50 < Spitfire> MasterBTB, please tone the language down.
14:50 < Joey> Spitfire: you're still missing my point
14:50 < Spitfire> Joey, staff can't prove that you're being PM spammed, and they're not going to kline people just because you claim you are.
14:50 < Spitfire> As such, complaining about it in here doesn't achieve anything.
14:50 < Spitfire> Especially when one of the users is in here, as you're just going to cause a fight.
14:50 < Joey> Spitfire: Why are you getting so emotional over trivial things?
14:50 < Spitfire> lol
14:50 < Nightmare> lolwut
14:50 < Joey> <3
14:51 < Spitfire> I'm merely explaining the facts to you, Joey.
14:51 < Nightmare> Spitfire doesn't get emotional
14:51 < Nightmare> Not even in bed
14:51 <@Jester> He isn't complaining, if he's being targeted on the network it's completely understandable. Please use /ignore , Joey

15:31 < Spitfire> Guest45651, I think they'd really rather you left them a PM rather than going in #help about it.

11:21 < iris773> hello
11:21 < iris773> i got a G.Tab P7510 and a G.Note N7000.
11:21 < bikcmp> hi
11:22 < iris773> although i was aware of the Note having emmc brick issues,
11:22 < iris773> i just found out that the Tab also has similar issues.
11:23 < iris773> currently, i am on the 4.0.4 version of stock android.
11:23 < bikcmp> even though it isn't a samsung epic, try asking #epic
11:23 < iris773> how do i find out if my tab also has the issue?
11:23 < iris773> @bikcmp, is this ONLY for samsung epic?
11:23 < iris773> this thread
11:24 < bikcmp> this channel is the network help channel
11:24 < bikcmp> has absolutely nothing to do with android
11:24 < bikcmp> #epic is for the samsung epic, though i think they may be able to help you out
11:24 < iris773> oops. i am so sorry
11:24 < bikcmp> np
11:24 < bikcmp> try #epic.

10:53 < Sakke> oh nevermind

12:19 < ErikMouse> Hey there, I have a question that I want to find out about.
12:21 < ShitshitSHitShitlol> what would that be
12:22 <@huru> Hi there.
12:23 < ErikMouse> If huru or something is around, I would like to find out about if I can get a channel transferred to me. It's #cloudcentral which was for Cloud's forums, but someone else has it registered October last year and it doesn't appear that they have been using it for much and left me as the only OP in it by default.
12:24 <@huru> Last seen  : Oct 05 15:39:02 2012 (4 weeks, 6 days, 22:41:13 ago)
12:24 <@huru> well the user has been on recently
12:25 <@huru> ErikMouse: if you can get wildclaw to come on
12:25 <@huru> and approve it
12:25 <@huru> i have no issue.
12:28 < ErikMouse> That tells me Wildclaw hasn't been on for over a month now according to that date.
12:29 <@huru> indeed, but a month isn't really that long, a few users do get busy but come back.
12:32 < ErikMouse> Well then, we'll have to give him a few more months to see if he comes back on to chat with and see if he would approve the channel transfer, otherwise if he hasn't signed on, may have to consider him not coming back and you approve the channel transfer to me. That is what I'm currently thinking.
12:33 <@huru> indeed.

13:53 < bikcmp> it is not confidential in any way/shape/form :)

13:56 < TheVoid> lol opers get no idle time in whois
13:56 < TheVoid> not good idea
13:56 < TheVoid> people might need to talk to them

13:56 < TheVoid> if it's pointless may as well justremove it for normal users too

14:02 < Nightmare> etc
14:02 < Nightmare> works fine for me
14:02 < Nightmare> (note that you need to do /whois nick nick with the nick twice if you want idle time to be shown)
14:04 < TheVoid> wtf
14:04 < TheVoid> Nightmare: oic
14:04 < TheVoid> weird lol
14:05 < TheVoid> maybe its the server admin line blocking it so the idle time isn't shown
14:05 < TheVoid> so twice is required
14:05  * TheVoid shrugs
14:06 < Nightmare> Nope, it works that way for everyone
14:06 < Nightmare> You have to do the nick twice so it does whois on the server they're on
14:06 <+huru> Yeah, idle time is usually unique to the local server you're on.
14:06 < TheVoid> Nightmare: lol weird
14:07 < Nightmare> so you might not have to do nick twice for idle time if they're on the same server as you

00:30 < Nightmare> Zenexer: I'm pretty sure that's just one of Joah's boxes
00:30 < Nightmare> seeing as he IRCs from it on occasion
00:31 < Nightmare> anyway, one of the IRCd boxes having an rDNS having nothing to do with the network, so I don't see why it's an issue ;p
00:31 < Nightmare> + does not affect it
00:42 < TyRex> yeah thts joahs box
00:43 <+huru> Yeah
00:43 <+huru> Thats Joah's vps.

19:15 < Joel> Are you trying to kick someone?
19:15 < DarkAceLaptop> /remove gets out around most auto-rejoins
19:16 <+huru> DarkAceLaptop: we use charybdis which is a pretty minimalistic ircd, we don't offer any flashy commands like /remove.
19:16 < DarkAceLaptop> fak
19:16 <+huru> DarkAceLaptop: best way would be to ban someone
19:16 <+huru> and kick them
19:16 < Joel> /kickban
19:16 <+huru> yeah
19:16 < DarkAceLaptop> and remove ban
19:16 <+huru> well if you want yeah
19:17 < DarkAceLaptop> yes, but annoying, and they sometimes think that you banned 'em for good
19:17 < Joel> Hold on.
19:17 < Joel> There's a temporary ban that can be removed after a certain period of time.
19:17 < Joel> AKICK.
19:17 < Joel> /cs help akick
19:17 < DarkAceLaptop> /cs akick #channel add person time?
19:17 < Joel> No, you'd have to specify a time limit.
19:18 < Joel> How long would you like the ban to last?
19:18 < DarkAceLaptop> 1 second, I guess
19:18 < DarkAceLaptop> /cs akick #channel add person 1s?
19:18 <+huru> /msg ChanServ AKICK #channel ADD nickname !T 1m
19:19 <+huru> i dont think theres any point doing it in seconds
19:19 < Joel> ^
19:19 <+huru> just ban them for a minute
19:19 < Joel> No, there really isn't.
19:19 < Joel> Are you trying to stop automatic rejoin, DarkAceLaptop?
19:19 < DarkAceLaptop> yes
19:19 < DarkAceLaptop> /remove does that for most
19:20 < Joel> sad day huru
19:20 < Joel> don't have +J loaded

19:20 < Joel> * cmode :              rejoin immediately after being kicked.
19:20 <+huru> lol
19:20 <+huru> Joel: This is charybdis ircd
19:20 <+huru> dont expect anything flashy
19:20 < Joel> lol
19:20 < DarkAceLaptop> anyways, I'll just make a custom command to make it unban a few seconds after when I use /r or someshit
19:20 < DarkAceLaptop> o/
19:21 < Joel> You could do that.
19:25 < Joel> /ban NICK

12:00 < Saku> awesome
12:16 <+huru> Saku: normally, in most circumstances nobody needs more than 15 characters for their nicknames.
12:18 < Saku> why not increase the limit though?
12:18 <+huru> Saku: Also to change it, would require us to recompile and reboot every server on the network, and as you could imagine, stability is a number one priority for us. When we start to deploy a newer version of charybdis we will look into it, unfortunately for now, you are stuck with 15 characters.

14:20 < Saku> not very good at explaining
14:20 < Saku> but uh
14:20 < Saku> the button that's supposed to make ' happen

14:21 < Saku> only when I type in this xchat message box
14:22 < Saku> my keyboard looks like this: http://www.saunalahti.fi/janij/blog/images/2008_jun_finnish_keyboard_layout.png

14:30 < Saku> apparently it's called keyboard layout
14:30 <+tunicwriter> Saku: I would try restarting xchat. If I recall correctly, it should default to your system's keyboard layout.
