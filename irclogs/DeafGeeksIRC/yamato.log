01:15 -Yamato(Yamato@c-50-138-131-165.hsd1.ct.comcast.net)- I think it's broken.
01:15 -Yamato(Yamato@c-50-138-131-165.hsd1.ct.comcast.net)- It may have killed an old P3 machine I had.
01:15 -!- Irssi: Starting query in DeafGeeksIRC with Yamato
01:16 <`> in other words, this is a troll?
01:19 <Yamato> No.
01:19 <Yamato> I really have the card.
01:19 <Yamato> I don't know if it's a dud or not.
01:19 <Yamato> This is a could-be troll.

01:25 <`> heh
01:25 <Yamato> I could give him my GeForce 8500GT with the heatsink/fan that melted.
01:26 <`> what
01:26 <`> the heatsink actually melted?
01:26 <Yamato> Sort of.
01:26 <`> >mfw
01:26 <Yamato> It was a cheapo piece of shit Chaintech.
01:26 <`> never heard of that happening.
01:26 <`> even with pieces of shit.
01:27 <`> laptops, different story
01:27 <`> but still.
01:27 <Yamato> It didn't melt MELT, but it got hot enough to warp it pretty badly.
01:27 <Yamato> For a little while there I had to use onboard S3 graphics.
01:27 <Yamato> Where the software renderer was faster than the GPU itself.
01:28 <`> Ugh.
