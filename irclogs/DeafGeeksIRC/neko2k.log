21:51 <`> yea, im here.
21:51 <`> if you still are.
21:51 <neko2k> ah
21:51 <neko2k> hi
21:51 <`> and yeah, i got the package, haven't played the game yet :P
21:51 <`> fuck yeah duct tape
21:51 <neko2k> okay, good :D
21:52 <`> :D
21:54 <neko2k> k so that's basically all i wanted to catch you for
21:55 <neko2k> but do let me know if you can't use the money order that got sent; my mom was in walmart and they only send money orders via Moneygram, not Western Union
21:56 <neko2k> i've got the receipts and stuff, so it shouldn't be a problem to get it changed out for something sent via Western Union
