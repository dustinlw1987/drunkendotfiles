01:36 <DONGS> actually, you provide an interesting solution
01:37 <DONGS> depending on your ability to deal with the heat of a thousand suns, i could use you as a jumping off point
01:37 <DONGS> what's your connection like
01:40 <`> https://twitter.com/#!/dustinlw1987/status/167324059212849152
01:40 <`> just today.
01:41 <`> i have no official shit with my hosting .____.
01:41 <`> i need to start separating out the financials for DGD
01:41 <`> (so far it's just a personal freelance, mixed in with my finances)
01:41 <DONGS> dude.
01:41 <DONGS> get this.
01:42 <`> ?
01:44 <DONGS> 40$ a customer
01:44 <DONGS> on a quad core with 16gb of ram
01:44 <`> :3c
01:44 <DONGS> 4GB of ram per customer
01:45 <`> what's the expense per quadcore/16G
01:45 <DONGS> the only issue is cost of hosting
01:45 <DONGS> dunno, that's what the initial investment is
01:45 <DONGS> the issue is hosting the box somewhere
01:45 <`> my thought is to resel initially
01:45 <`> *resell
01:45 <DONGS> huh?
01:46 <DONGS> no, i'm saying
01:46 <DONGS> i fold you in *right now*
01:46 <`> ah.
01:46 <DONGS> because i'm not paying myself anything yet
01:46 <DONGS> it's going half to costs half to server fund
01:46 <`> alright, uh
01:46 <`> i can setup a debian system for you to configure
01:47 <DONGS> i can send you a box, don't worry
01:47 <`> alright
01:47 <`> type of box?
01:47 <DONGS> my issue is: how much would you charge
01:47 <`> yeah, i'm not sure.
01:47 <DONGS> here's the pitch
01:47 <`> if it's "enough" - i can get 150mbit internuts
01:48 <DONGS> the more money that goes into the fund immediately
01:48 <DONGS> the more money for boxen at softlayer
01:48 <`> 150mbit/35mbit
01:48 <`> afaik
01:48 <`> prob is that it's $150 ($1 per mbit)
01:48 <DONGS> the biggest issue is uplink
01:48 <`> yup
01:48 <DONGS> we need all the fucking uplink we can get for this
01:48 <`> so really, no difference
01:49 <`> (150/35 vs current 35/35)
01:50 <`> so honestly, i'll do this
01:51 <`> because any $ would help. :]
01:51 <DONGS> of course
01:51 <DONGS> alright, i'm gonna do up a few more charts
01:51 <`> okies.
01:51 <`> i'll just ask for *one* thing for you to send the box with
01:52 <DONGS> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhOirstu-bGDdEU0bjluQlEzeFRWN1BZQ1FaSExJcFE&hl=en_US#gid=0
01:52 <DONGS> not weed
01:52 <DONGS> i'll drive that myself
01:53 <`> http://goo.gl/3FlHm
01:53 <DONGS> heh
01:53 <`> so i can replace my aging EF4116
01:53 <`> (100mbit)
01:54 <`> and weed's a given. if you come down here, we'll definitely get some.
01:54 <`> :P
01:55 <`> right now, my network's like this
01:56 <`> ONT -> Ethernet -> linux-x86 router -> EF4116 100mbit switch -> WRT320N with 4-port gigabit switch
01:57 <`> since i'm using the WRT320N for the LAN
01:57 <`> and the EF4116 for 100mbit-only devices
01:57 <`> works out well, since the bottleneck is at the EF4116->Router
01:57 <`> and that's negligible due to the fact my uplink's only 35/35mbit
01:58 <`> i need to redo the WRT320N anyway
01:58 <`> so i can include the WAN port into the switch
01:58 <DONGS> ignore this
01:58 <DONGS> Hostname: nagisa - OS: FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE-p3/amd64 - CPU: AMD Sempron(tm) Processor 3200+ (1808.34-MHz K8-class CPU) - Processes: 81 - Uptime: 70d 11h 5m - Load Average: 0.00 - Memory Usage: 37.39MB/943.89MB (3.96%) - Disk Usage: 58.03GB/564.99GB (10.27%)
01:58 <`> so i'll have 5 ports
01:59 <DONGS> wait
01:59 <DONGS> wrong server anyway
01:59 <DONGS> i'm a dolt
01:59 <`> whats up
01:59 <`> lols AMD K8
02:01 <`> hmm >mw
02:01 <`> *mfw
02:01 <`> the SE2800 isn't wallmountable
02:04 <`> i like to mount everything possible
02:04 <`> so it saves as much space as possible.
02:06 <`> anyway.

03:03 <`> damn.
03:04 <`> makes me wonder where you would be
03:04 <`> had you gone.
03:04 <DONGS> dead
03:04 <DONGS> i'm not doubting it
03:04 <`> yeah, thats what i thought too
03:04 <`> :|
03:04 <`> damn
03:04 <DONGS> this is how i'm paying you back
03:04 <DONGS> by grabbing you and carrying you out of assland
03:05 <`> lol
03:05 <DONGS> it's gonna be a rough start though
03:05 <DONGS> how much is it to get more ip addrs?
03:06 <`> no clue
03:06 <`> but that'd require getting biz VZ account
03:06 <`> not sure how that'd work.
03:06 <`> i wonder if there's a possibility of installing an 2nd ONT separate from the rez account.
03:07 <`> ...probably, but $$$$$$$
03:09 <`> i actually wouldn't mind that
03:10 <`> put it under the Hardesty Hosting name
03:10 <`> etc
03:10 <`> thoughts?
03:11 <`> Yup, VZ will allow this. Just have to call it in.
03:13 <`> http://smallbusiness.verizon.com/products/internet/fios/overview.aspx#overview
03:15 <`> ouch.
03:15 <`> $85/mo for 25/25
03:15 <`> i can add it right now, actually
03:16 <`> that's dynamic
03:16 <`> for static, uh
03:16 <`> 25/25, $105
03:16 <`> 35/35, $125
03:16 <`> 50/20, $190
03:17 <`> and afaik, i can get 5 static IP
03:18 <`> ^ pricing is for 2-year term.
03:19 <`> i'd need to do it over the phone since they "charge" $99 for a biz router
03:19 <`> online, as a one-time charge
03:19 <`> which is BS
03:22 <`> i dont mind you covering that + cost of IPs (if applicable)
03:22 <`> and maybe $20 on the side for power/food
03:22 <`> and we'd call it even.

01:21 <`> 13063 5th St. Sp. 51 92399
01:21 <`> exactly
01:21 <DONGS> where aer you
01:21 <DONGS> there
01:22 <`> yes, create biz
01:22 <`> then you should see options
01:22 <DONGS> 124
01:22 <`> mind you, this has to be called in so they dont fuck with my residental account
01:23 <`> that's right.
01:23 <DONGS> bah
01:23 <`> ?
01:23 <DONGS> i'm going to end up having the move there hand forced
01:24 <`> yeah.
01:24 <DONGS> hold on
01:24 <`> so we can consolidate/work together more efficiently
01:24 <DONGS> it's basically
01:24 <DONGS> move there host there
01:24 <`> pretty much
01:25 <DONGS> or convice grandparents of splitting difference
01:25 <`> i kinda think that'll make things easier/quicker
01:25 <`> and i think your gparents would try to help you out with the move
01:25 <`> cuz they're all gtfo, right?
01:25 <DONGS> no
01:25 <DONGS> but what the fuck
01:26 <DONGS> 50Mbps/10Mbps
01:26 <DONGS> 10mbps?
01:26 <`> yeah, stupid.
01:26 <`> thats why im going for 35/35
01:26 <`> you gotta admit, symmetrical is pretty rare
01:26 <`> even for rez accounts
01:26 <`> i'm 35/35, but it's more like 42/30
01:26 <`> but still, i'm happy with that
01:27 <`> even if i went 150mbit
01:27 <`> that'd still net me only 20mbit upload
01:27 <`> which is stupid
01:28 <`> so 35/35 is the best option all-round
01:28 <`> + biz/staticIP
01:32 <DONGS> i'm still here
01:32 <`> ok.
