16:57 -!- Irssi: Starting query in DeafGeeksIRC with Miah-mobile
16:57 <`> yo?
16:58 <Miah-mobile> Debian is Pissing me off
16:59 <Miah-mobile> And now win7 won't load cuz grub error. Fml
16:59 <`> dude.
17:00 <`> lets reinstall debian
17:00 <`> but lets do it step-by-step
17:02 <Miah-mobile> I did a reinstall with LAN connected and I had web, but only debian.org. wiki Google etc would work 
17:03 <Miah-mobile> Okay we can do that. I had Dongs walk me thru but he was in a hurry to leave so
17:07 <Miah-mobile> Wouldn't* work. Sorry
17:12 <Miah-mobile> Walk me thru
17:13 <`> wait wait
17:13 <`> you have debian installed
17:13 <`> but?
17:13 <`> we can get internet working on it
17:13 <`> we'll need to get it to update stuff
17:14 <`> but what was wrong with it?
17:14 <Miah-mobile> It won't update anything
17:14 <Miah-mobile> The only connection I have is www.debian.org and the rest of the sites map
17:14 <Miah-mobile> No other domain works
17:15 <`> pull the terminal
17:15 <Miah-mobile> And apt-get won't work
17:15 <`> just pull the terminal
17:15 <`> then do this
17:15 <`> ifconfig
17:15 <`> then it should spit out various internet interfaces
17:15 <Miah-mobile> Okay one sec
17:16 <`> i want you to give me one that says something like "192.168.1.6" (the last 2 digits can be different), or "10.0.0.0" (also last 2 digits can be different)
17:16 <`> for its IP address
17:16 <Miah-mobile> BTW Dongs had me Dl a firmware zip and its on my phone (for WiFi devices)
17:17 <`> yeah. hold on, though, since you can load debian.org
17:17 <`> that means it's gotta have some kind of internet connection
17:17 <`> did you connect to wifi or something?
17:18 <`> if connected to wifi
17:18 <Miah-mobile> 'bash: ifconfig: command not found
17:18 <`> kk
17:18 <`> do this
17:18 <`> traceroute debian.org
17:18 <`> and then tell me the first 3 hops
17:18 <Miah-mobile> Is this all root?
17:18 <`> nope
17:18 <`> traceroute can be done as normal user
17:19 <Miah-mobile> debian.org: name or service not known
17:19 <`> that means it's not even connected to the internet
17:19 <`> AT ALL
17:20 <`> you never answered my question.
17:20 <`> WIFI NOR NOT?
17:20 <`> *OR
17:20 <Miah-mobile> cannot handle 'host' cmdline Wth 'debian.org' or position 1 (argc1)
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI
17:20 <`> IS IT WIFI

17:20 <Miah-mobile> I'm not at LAN anymore
17:20 <`> ....
17:21 <`> youre not making sense
17:21 <`> IS IT LAN OR WIFI?
17:21 <Miah-mobile> LAN is in kitchen, I am in my room atm
17:21 <`> it needs to be connected to LAN for now, can you do that?
17:21 <Miah-mobile> I got connection via LAN!!!
17:21 <`> ok
17:21 <`> do this first
17:21 <Miah-mobile> Yes I can
17:22 <`> do you have a connection via lan now?
17:22 <Miah-mobile> No. Do u want me to go connect it?
17:22 <`> yes, please.
17:22 <Miah-mobile> Okay give me a few mins to move everything lol
17:22 <`> (i'm half tempted to buy a plane ticket, tell u to stfu, fly over there, fix all your shit. :D)
17:23 <`> (jk)
17:23 <Miah-mobile> I wouldn't mind lol
17:24 <`> heh $$$
