05:13 <`> er, gonna crash in a bit.
05:14 <Miah|Linux> but, but, but...
05:14 <`> i know
05:14 <`> you can live. :P
05:15 <Miah|Linux> lol
05:15 <Miah|Linux> one question...
05:15 <`> hmm?
05:15 <Miah|Linux> GTK3 and GTK2...what are those? lol
05:16 <`> GIMP ToolKit
05:16 <`> then the version numbers.
05:16 <`> http://www.gtk.org/
05:17 <`> basically it's a bunch of frameworks and shared libraries for making GUIs
05:17 <Miah|Linux> http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Holo-280076980?
05:17 <Miah|Linux> do i need it for this?
05:18 <Miah|Linux> or gnome tool kit?
05:19 <`> you need it.
05:19 <`> it's still useful
05:19 <`> BUT
05:20 <`> it depends on what engine you're using.
05:20 <Miah|Linux> engine?
05:20 <`> if you're using murrine and/or pixbuf engines, use GTK2 theme
05:20 <`> if unico and/or adwaita engines, use GTK3
05:21 <`> *GTK3 theme
05:21 <Miah|Linux> lost me lol
05:22 <`> then i suggest learning about it
05:22 <`> http://gnome-look.org/
05:22 <`> that site should have the appropriate info
05:22 <`> and it has EVERYTHING too
05:22 <Miah|Linux> lol ok

05:25 <Miah|Linux> nod
05:26 <Miah|Linux> but are these all the same for linux/ubuntu/debian
05:26 <`> no
05:26 <`> it's slightly different
05:26 <Miah|Linux> i ask because i dont know if i am going to stay with linux mint or go back to ubuntu
05:27 <`> well
05:27 <`> both are kinda the same
05:27 <Miah|Linux> ok
05:27 <`> but still with fundamental differents
05:27 <`> *differences
05:27 <`> like where shit is
05:27 <`> but how it runs shit should be fairly the same
05:28 <`> i.e. apt-get shit should be same
05:28 <Miah|Linux> okay bro
05:28 <`> yup
05:28 <Miah|Linux> well you go to bed lol

05:28 <`> just so the bowl's totally empty
05:28 <`> }:A
05:29 <Miah|Linux> nice haha
05:29 <`> this nacho cheese is expensive
05:29 <`> and it kinda turns into liquid if you dont eat it/use it right away
05:29 <`> no preservatives, bro
05:30 <Miah|Linux> high quality
05:30 <`> yup
05:30 <`> so i threw some croutons in there
05:30 <`> and ate it all
