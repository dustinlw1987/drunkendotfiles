10:00 < Kel> I have a nazi parent...
10:00 < Mariorulez14> She doesn't like you talking to us
10:00 < Mariorulez14> ?
10:00 < CH|NotAwayYet> that's why you don't talk to Jake first
10:01 < Kel> good point. but jaek's the only one I know in real life, so she's more okay with him.. D:
10:01 < Mariorulez14> Does she WANT you to be a creepy antisocial person like Shadowfan
10:01 < Kel> apparently, yes.
10:01 < Kel> x3
10:01 < Kel> she doesn't understand the internetz.
10:01 < Mariorulez14> Your mom and Ryan's mom should get together and be antisocial buddies
10:01 < CH|NotAwayYet> lol
10:01 < Kel> lol.
10:01 < Kel> yes.
10:01 < CH|NotAwayYet> i wonder if Shadowfan has some guy named Garret on his skyp friends list
10:01 < Mariorulez14> The only downside is that Ryan's mom would think that it meant Ryan got free game at dating you, Kel
10:02 < Kel> really, mario?
10:02 < Kel> o3o
10:02 < Kel> weirds.
10:02 < Mariorulez14> Her entire dating logic is shitty, though
10:02 < Mariorulez14> "I KNOW YOUR PARENTS, YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GO OUT WITH MY SON
10:02 < CH|NotAwayYet> so carry a brick in your purse
10:02 < Kel> My dating logic is shitty, though.
10:02 < CH|NotAwayYet> problem sovled

10:02 < Kel> "OH MAH GOSH YOU TALKED TO ME, YOU MUST BE TOTALLY INTO ME LAWLS"
10:02 < Mariorulez14> My dating logic: "We should just go hang out or do something we'd both enjoy. No sex though, I'm saving myself."
10:03 < Kel> ^ ... that is good dating logic.
10:03 < CH|NotAwayYet> ^
10:03 < Kel> I'm more of a flirt right now,
10:03 < CH|NotAwayYet> <derpbot> ( 110 ) <Kel> you're cayoot, CH. <CH|E420> hehehehehehehe a girl called me cute *ego overinflation*
10:03 < CH|NotAwayYet> yes
10:03 < CH|NotAwayYet> yes you are
10:03 < Kel> but when I find someone I like I'm not so flirty.
10:03 < Kel> D:
10:03 < Mariorulez14> Then my mom blows it out of proportion by giving me money and making me dress up semi-nice even though we're just sitting somewhere
10:03 < Kel> I have oogles of charm, just not for the guys I actually crush on.
10:03 < Kel> D':
10:03 < Mariorulez14> Heheh
10:04 < Kel> Mario, you sound sweet, though! I'd be thrilled to go on a "hang out" kinda date.
10:04 < Mariorulez14> The girls in my town that have crushes on me make it really obvious though
10:04 < Mariorulez14> I think it's because I'm such a damn good listener :3

10:17 < Kel> OH DEAR GOD, DOLAN
10:17 < Kel> NO DARMAN, NOT COOL.
10:21 < Mariorulez14> lol
10:28 < Mariorulez14> Kel, do you remember Know Your Stars?
10:28 < Mariorulez14> From All That
10:28 < Kel> Oh geez.
10:28 < Kel> uh... no.
10:28 < Kel> I'm a youngin'.
10:29 < Mariorulez14> Aw
10:29 < Kel> I kind of remember All That, but barely.
10:29 < Mariorulez14> That was such a good show
10:29 < Mariorulez14> Wish I could find it again
10:30 < Kel> I want to find the Amanda show again, that was the best. x3
10:31 < Mariorulez14> I remember that
10:31 < Mariorulez14> That was the period of TV where sketch comedy shows were done right
10:31 < Mariorulez14> All That! and The Amanda Show were both really awesome
10:31 < Mariorulez14> Now we just have crap like So Random that aren't even funny
10:32 < Kel> I know.
10:32 < Kel> Actually, a lot of previously good channels have shitty stuff.
10:32 < Kel> Like  Disney Channel?
10:32 < Kel> And MTV, where it actually used to have music?
10:32 < Mariorulez14> Yeah, lol
10:33 < Mariorulez14> MTV doesn't even play music anymore 
10:33 < Mariorulez14> It's ridiculous ._.
10:33 < Mariorulez14> Disney had a good run in the early 2000s, then they cancelled/ended all their good shows like Kim Possible and Lilo & Stitch: The Series
10:33 < Mariorulez14> Among other things
10:34 < Mariorulez14> L&S was awesomesauce
10:34 < Kel> Yeah, Kim Possible was awesome too!
10:34 < Kel> even Nick had good shows.
10:34 < Kel> Like Cat-Dog. x3
10:34 < Kel> yeaah, never mind. x3
10:35 < Kel> Or like... Rocket Power.
10:35 < Kel> That was awesome.
10:36 < Mariorulez14> Ye yes yes, Rocket Power
10:37 < Mariorulez14> I really find it hard to believe that a lot of old 90's/early 2000's Nick shows were made by the same company
10:37 < Mariorulez14> Klasky-Csupo made Rocket Power, Wild Thornberries, Hey Arnold, Rugrats, etc. iirc
10:37 < Kel> Really?
10:38 < Kel> Crazy!
10:38 < Kel> I loved a lot of those, it explains a lot.
10:38 < Kel> SMASHING. ;D
10:38 < Mariorulez14> It's like learning that a voice actor did voices for a show you had no idea
10:39 < Mariorulez14> Like how Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson) and Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle/Timmy Turner/Dill Pickles/a whole bunch of other people) were in Kim Possible
10:39 < Mariorulez14> Tara even played a cheerleader named Tara :P
10:39 < Kel> NO WAY. x3
10:39 < Mariorulez14> Nancy was Rufus 
10:39 < Kel> THAT'S EPIC. x3
10:39 < Mariorulez14> Which now that I think about it, I can totally hear the resemblane
10:39 < Mariorulez14> It's like a squeakier and a bit higher Bart

21:07 < `> lols
21:07 < `> wat
21:08 < `> maybe it was just a hiccup
21:08 < Mariorulez14> I was sitting in a McDonald's trying to connect through both Mibbit and Xchat
21:08 < `> mibbit is banned fyi
21:08 < Tama> hiccups are burps with turrets
21:08 < `> some of their servers, anyway
21:08 < Mariorulez14> Mibbit kept saying that I was banned and Xchat wouldn't accept the connection
21:08 < `> so it's a hit and miss
21:08 < `> Mariorulez14: how were you connecting on xchat?
21:08 < Mariorulez14> ?
21:09 < `> ssl or nonssl?
21:09 < Mariorulez14> Non-SSL iirc
21:09 < `> can you try again?
21:09 < `> i want to see whats up :P
21:09 < randomperson> hi mario
