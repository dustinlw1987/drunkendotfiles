22:22 <Miah|Ubuntu> looking through some conky pages and customizing it looks hard :/
22:26 <`> it is.
22:26 <`> i usually just look for the best conky confs and pick one
22:26 <`> http://desktopspotting.com/26/best-conky-configs-for-linux-desktop/
22:27 <`> Conky - Planet looks badass. I'd choose that.
22:30 <`> personally
22:30 <`> i used "Just Another Conky"
22:30 <`> before i went Debian
22:30 <`> i haven't reconfigured conky
22:30  * ` shrugs
