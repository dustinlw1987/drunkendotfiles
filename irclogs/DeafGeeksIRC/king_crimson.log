03:02 <`> Thanks!
03:02 <king_crimson> cool
03:02 <king_crimson> will get this out
03:03 <king_crimson> np brah
03:03 <king_crimson> i hope it doesn't turn out to be mobo-related
03:03 <`> that'd suck
03:03 <king_crimson> and this chip does work, i tried it on a working board here a while ago after i pulled it off the dead one
03:03 <`> but it did definitely choke hard on L2
03:03 <king_crimson> didn't give it a hardcore test but it POSTs
03:03 <king_crimson> yeah

15:41 -!- Irssi: Starting query in DeafGeeksIRC with king_crimson
15:41 <king_crimson> telnet to irc.rubbermallet.org port 2323
15:41 <king_crimson> username dustin
15:41 <king_crimson> password turbotea
15:41 <king_crimson> also, it doesn't have irssi
15:41 <king_crimson> it has "irc"
15:41 <king_crimson> slink is fucking ancient
15:41 <king_crimson> but its the newest that runs fast on that thing
15:42 <king_crimson> theres not too much on that box, pretty much just a base install of a 15 year old debian
15:42 <king_crimson> with a few extras like irc etc
15:42 <`> }:A
15:43 <`> still, it's pretty damn cool
15:43 <`> trying now
15:43 <king_crimson> yeah
15:43 <king_crimson> its a fun toy
15:43 <king_crimson> im surprised how smoothly it runs actually
15:43 <king_crimson> in only 16 MB RAM
15:44 <`> wow
15:44 <`> i forgot how much telnet sucked
15:44 <king_crimson> lol
15:44 <king_crimson> whats the problem
15:44 <`> like during login
15:44 <`> if i fuck up and backspace
15:44 <king_crimson> if you've got a good client, it works great
15:44 <king_crimson> oh
15:44 <`> it doesn't backspace
15:44 <king_crimson> well, after login its fine
15:45 <`> wow
15:45 <king_crimson> even if i bothered to compile an sshd, it would suck to use because of the encryption
15:45 <`> it definitely doesnt like my term
15:45 <king_crimson> hmm
15:45 <king_crimson> in windows i use putty, works perfectly
15:45 <`> :P
15:45 <`> >windows
15:45 <`> it's liek, designed to use telnet
15:46 <`> which has been depreciated for a decade or possibly longer
15:46 <king_crimson> nah the built in windows telnet client blows goat dongs
15:46 <king_crimson> putty is way better
15:46 <`> even then
15:46 <`> iirc theres no true telnet client for mac
15:46 <king_crimson> yeah
