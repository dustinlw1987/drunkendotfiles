03:56 <`> display's spazzing
03:56 <CLUBDONGS> i figured
03:56 <`> ok
03:56 <CLUBDONGS> did it actually make it to X?
03:56 <`> it's at login
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> wow
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> login then
03:57 <`> but at VERY VERY low colorate
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> yeah i figure
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> that i can fix
03:57 <`> ._.
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> did you login?
03:57 <`> time to learn awesomewm
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> wow
03:57 <`> yes i did, as dissimulo
03:57 <CLUBDONGS> you realize that was all autoconfig
03:58 <`> heres the catch
03:58 <`> fucking trackpad has no rightclick
03:58 <CLUBDONGS> easy
03:58 <CLUBDONGS> i'll rebind rightclick to fn+ckick
03:58 <CLUBDONGS> *click
03:58 <`> k
03:58 <CLUBDONGS> or i can install xfce
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> would be easier on your
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> *you
03:59 <`> eh
03:59 <`> no
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> especially with one button
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> actually i'm kinda recommending onebutton xfce or lxde
03:59 <`> which one?
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> awesome is a lot of leftbutton
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> you'll need a lot of fingers
03:59 <`> lets try xfce?
03:59 <CLUBDONGS> ok
04:00 <CLUBDONGS> hold on to your hat
04:00 <`> it just went back to my running htop
04:00 <`> :P
04:00 <`> i just left htop up
04:00 <`> since it matches the lime green 'look'
04:00 <`> }:A
04:01 <`> meanwhile
04:02 <`> i'm gonna dab up a hit
04:02 <CLUBDONGS> heh
04:02 <CLUBDONGS> when my gma goes to bed i might make a bong and hit that last bit of kief
04:03 <`> plan on getting more
04:03 <`> keep yourself supplied
04:03 <`> i find that having it helps life overall
04:05 <CLUBDONGS> not for me actually
04:05 <CLUBDONGS> the next day always sucks for me
04:07 <`> idk
04:08 <`> i find it key to have 'wind-down' time
04:08 <`> time to yourself where it's fuck-all, and just relax.

04:32 <`> kk
04:34 <CLUBDONGS> yeah it worked
04:34 <CLUBDONGS> how slow is it going
04:34 <CLUBDONGS> and what do the colors look like
04:37 <`> colors are like 4 bit or 8 bit or some shit like that
04:37 <`> loads pretty average
04:38 <`> but hey, i like xfce!
04:40 <`> but it looks to have cleared itself
04:40 <CLUBDONGS> cleared itself?
04:40 <`> it spazzed, and set to the right rezs and colors
04:41 <`> after i selected "default config" for xfce
04:41 <CLUBDONGS> oh
04:41 <CLUBDONGS> yeah i still need to solidly config X
04:42 <`> whats hilarious
04:42 <`> is that xfce looks like a bad os x ripoff
04:42 <`> out of the box
04:42 <`> dock at the bottom, panel at the top
04:43 <`> and this is on a ibook g3 mac
04:43 <`> :D
04:43 <CLUBDONGS> :3
04:43 <CLUBDONGS> default xfce settings are silly
04:43 <CLUBDONGS> lemme check out wicd a sec
04:43 <`> kk

04:46 <CLUBDONGS> it doesn't have the wlan fw installed
04:47 <`> yeah, i remember
04:47 <`> it's an airport b adapter
