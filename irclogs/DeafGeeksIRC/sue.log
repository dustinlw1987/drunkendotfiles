22:53 <Sue> if you want a light DM
22:53 <`> i want this i7 to fucking SCREAM
22:53 <Sue> install freebsd
22:53 <Sue> i'm almost serious
22:53 <`> EH
22:53 <`> debian is as far as i'll go
22:53 <`> :)
22:53 <`> at least for now
22:53 <Sue> weak :3
22:53 <`> you're in sudoers now
22:53 <Sue> fbsd isn't actually that
22:53 <Sue> "hard"
22:54 <Sue> actually, get this
22:54 <`> the fact you have to airquote "hard"
22:54 <`> ...
22:54 <Sue> i airquote it
22:54 <Sue> because it's got the stigma of it being hard attached to it
22:54 <`> psh
22:54 <Sue> unlike linux systems, you can actually cron most system maintenance
22:54 <Sue> also
22:54 <Sue> you know zfs, right?
22:54 <Sue> you know what it is
22:55 <`> notrly
22:55 <`> wellyes
22:55 <Sue> zfs is the filesystem sun made for solaris and opensourced
22:55 <`> i know it as a filesystem that has raid features on steroids
22:55 <Sue> not just that
22:55 <Sue> so it has snapshotting
22:55 <Sue> full filesystem snapshotting
22:55 <`> see
22:56 <`> i have a problem with changing platforms
22:56 <Sue> you can safely rm -R /
22:56 <`> i *know* how linux runs
22:56 <`> i know where shit is
22:56 <Sue> and push one button and all your files are there
22:56 <`> with fbsd, i'd have to learn it
22:56 <Sue> not really
22:56 <`> i'd rather learn it while you're around
22:56 <Sue> hah
22:56 <`> so if i fuck something up
22:56 <`> :D
22:56 <Sue> >he wants a roommate
22:56 <`> i fucking do

22:57 <`> ....
22:57 <`> you havent seen that movie?
22:58 <Sue> >he thinks i've seen movies
22:58 <`> it's campy, but is a good story/plot
22:58 <`> about antitrust issues, stealing source, and bullshit like that
22:58 <`> i REALLY REALLY want to get my hands on skullbocks.com
22:58 <Sue> i have watched possibly 20 good movies in my life

05:22 <`> okay
05:23 <`> what happened, though?
05:27 <Sue> long story short, i was told i couldn't do my day to day hardesty hosting business from home and i'd have to run it from somewhere else like a friend's house
05:28 <Sue> like
05:28 <Sue> i'd have to drive to my friends house to run daily support/pr/business management
05:29 <Sue> if you haven't wtf'd yet, i've been doing it all night
05:29 <Sue> i can't follow that term, so i have to be out by the end of may
05:31 <`> i dont really get it
05:31 <Sue> exactly
05:31 <`> ??
05:32 <Sue> i was told i can't "sit on my ass" and i'd need to work somewhere else
05:32 <`> uhhhh
05:32 <`> that's what i do, 99% of the time
05:32 <`> oh well
05:32 <Sue> "excuse me, have you tried abating a constant weeklong ddos"
05:32 <Sue> "while supporting two other customers"
05:32 <Sue> they'll never get it
05:32 <Sue> so i have to leave
05:32 <`> aha, okay.
05:33 <Sue> and this isn't a back out, maybe
05:33 <Sue> i absolutely have to be out end of may
05:33 <`> no
05:33 <Sue> or i'm on the street
05:33 <`> ok, well, you better be serious this time.
05:33 <Sue> i'm damn serious
05:33 <`> because i'll prepare on this end.
05:33 <Sue> i'm off my fucking pills
05:34 <`> thought they were helping?
05:34 <Sue> they caused me to be even more lazy, plus super forgetful
05:34 <Sue> nope
05:34 <`> :(
05:36 <`> well, hopefully next month me and my mom will be getting a storage unit
05:36 <`> so we can free up a whole lot of space here
05:37 <Sue> i'm not gonna come with too much but i'll only have two seats
05:37 <Sue> back seat and trunk full
05:38 <`> yeah. i have way way more crap than that.
05:38 <`> you should be more than fine.
05:39 <`> i wonder if we should get bunk beds
05:39 <`> at least for now.
05:39 <`> until we're able to get an apartment or whatever
05:41 <`> what do you think?
05:42 <`> also, http://mosh.mit.edu/
05:42 <`> been using it for a while now, loving it.
05:44 <`> and what would be really fun is if i came up ahead, and then rode down with you to my place

05:50 <`> than i have in 6 years with this deaf friend.
05:50 <`> long story...
05:54 <`> though i have habits i need to break
05:54 <`> it's mostly the matter of motivation
05:54 <`> i've had no friends who really are 'into' what i'm into

04:21 <`> nothing like a fucking tiny router misconfig that cockblocked you from getting to certain routes on the VPN
04:23 <`> router was configured for a 10.0.0.0/8
04:23 <`> so that cockblocked me from reaching VPN'd networks
04:23 <`> so i set it for 10.0.0.0/16
04:23 <`> SUDDENLY COCKS
04:24 <Sue> why not 24?
04:24 <`> cuz 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24
04:24 <Sue> oh right
04:24 <`> technically /23
04:24 <`> but /16 is easier
04:26 <`> you'll need to kick your DHCP lease
04:26 <`> to pick up the new subnet mask
04:27 <`> imagine this is what got my panties in a bunch today
04:27 <`> i've been fighting with it
04:27 <`> all
04:27 <`> fucking
04:27 <`> day
04:28 <Sue> >first world nerd problems
04:28 <`> no fucking shit
04:28 <Sue> you had me all fucking worried
04:28 <`> i even had rackspace support
04:28 <`> on the line with me
04:28 <Sue> wow
04:28 <`> not one of the idiots either
04:28 <`> one of the smart ones
04:29 <`> a few, actually, conferenced in
04:29 <`> we were trying different configurations and all that bs
04:29 <`> isolated it to my machine
04:29 <`> still couldnt figure it out
04:29 <`> until i pointed out that i had a 10/8 network
04:29 <`> imagine collective facepalming
04:30 <Sue> that cat
04:31 <`> so i quickly reconfigured router for /16
04:31 <`> hopped back onto the vpn
04:31 <`> worked well
04:31 <`> but now i'm having them change out my password for one i can remember
04:31 <`> lolusingciscoanyconnectclient
04:32 <`> actually using an cisco ASA
04:33 <`> sad part is
04:33 <`> while i was on /8
04:33 <`> this machine couldn't get a v6 ip
04:33 <`> at all
04:33 <`> once i set shit to /16
04:33 <`> suddenly v6 long cock
04:39 <`> i do remember ubuntu picking it up fine
04:39 <`> >fuckin windows
04:40 <`> kill the old tunnel. with fire.
04:46 <`> okay
04:46 <`> just killed off all ssh and mosh rules off the ASA facing the internet
04:46 <`> the only way to touch it via those is via the VPN
04:47 <`> ultrasecure, bitch.
04:48 <`> here's the thing
04:49 <`> fucking thing is a tunnel via hurricane electric
04:51 <`> shortcut that bitch. you use it often enough.
04:53 <`> i already called verizon multiple times, went as far as to getting to my regional head end - nope, no ipv6... at least, not yet.
04:54 <Sue> same with comcast business and shit
04:55 <`> almost 60 just for 5/5
04:55 <`> fuckthatshit.jpg
04:55 <Sue> business sla
04:55 <`> i'd only do 50 and up
04:56 <`> if we were to bother getting a line
04:56 <Sue> yeah
04:56 <`> and only twc and verizon
04:56 <`> fyi
04:56 <Sue> 50 syc
04:56 <Sue> *sunc
04:57 <`> we're typically 'included' in redlands
04:57 <`> check out uh
04:58 <`> what's that free shell thingy that tid-- SDF
04:58 <`> Naked DSL = only internet, no phone.
04:58 <`> but yeah

05:00 <`> >$30ish
05:01 <`> i wouldnt midn
05:01 <`> strictly as a hot standby, actively loadbalanced
05:01 <`> i mean
05:01 <`> who wouldn't like geeky DSL?
05:01 <`> you get direct access to DSLAM, supposedly
05:02 <`> (stats, etc)
05:03 <Sue> i really hate touching this monitor
05:03 <`> yeah, but i saw that you needed to do it side-by-side to get it off
05:03 <Sue> it's the first lcd in two years
05:03 <`> yea
05:04 <Sue> well actually i got it on sale for 89
05:04 <Sue> but getting a new one: pricey as fuck
05:04 <Sue> and i don't wanna need to get a new one
05:05 <`> fuck comcast
05:05 <Sue> i know i know
05:05 <`> i will actively avoid living anywhere comcast has service
05:05 <Sue> you have strong convictions with your hate of certain companies
05:05 <`> you think?
05:06 <Sue> i think i'm gonna go to bed
05:06 <`> okay
05:07 <`> also, thanks for the offer of soda, but i really don't like soda, i drink it like really rarely
05:07 <`> just wanted to let you know

14:47 <`> normally, i'd have you hang out with me now and then
14:48 <`> but lately i didnt want you in here because of >mess
14:48 <`> x.x
14:48 <Sue> good luck getting me out of my chair
14:49 <`> btw
14:49 <`> we need to rebuild my mom's system
14:49 <`> it's a eeebox running debian squeeze (vomit)
14:50 <`> rebuild using xfce, etc
14:50 <`> so it's as lean as possible (with wicd)
14:50 <`> you down for it?
14:50 <Sue> oh god
14:51 <`> just shove the blue dildo into it
14:51 <`> reinstall :D
14:51 <Sue> let me do it, alright?
14:51 <`> pft fine.
14:52 <Sue> also, i'd recommend squeeze still
14:53 <Sue> unless you wanna go in there every day and update it for her
14:53 <Sue> every
14:53 <Sue> day
14:54 <Sue> squeeze, my way: light, duh proof

15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:23:26 PM] Dustin: but fffff no graphs
15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:23:58 PM] Dustin: it used to be in promsicuous mode
15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:24:03 PM] Dustin: so i killed that
15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:25:15 PM] Dustin: updating the router
15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:25:18 PM] Dustin: hold on to your panties.
15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:25:59 PM] Dustin: (updating to the latest build)
15:28 <`> [7/1/12 1:26:23 PM] Dustin: i always have it perform a full backup prior.
15:32 <`> we're back.
15:32 <`> and it's reinstalling packages now.
15:33 <`> we need to configure my UPSes for networking
15:33 <`> they both have a RJ-45 jack.
15:35 <`> one thing that i really hate
15:35 <`> is that bandwidthd's data gets overwritten
15:35 <`> every update.
15:36 <`> due to the behavior of the update: it deinstalls the packages, and then reinstalls.
15:36 <`> when it deinstalls, it also rips out the preexisting data
15:36 <`> = me grr
15:37 <`> so i need to figure out how to backup the bandwidthd data
15:37 <`> it apparently stores it into a CDF logfile
15:38 <`> yup
15:38 <`> outputs it to htdocs/log.cdf
15:38 <`> so i'll have to make sure i back that up
15:38 <`> and update
15:42 <`> seems you missed a whole bunch
15:43 <`> i forgot you were connected to xo1
15:43 <`> thats seriously my sign for jack in the box
15:44 <`> and
15:44 <`> i DID get jacked off in teh box
