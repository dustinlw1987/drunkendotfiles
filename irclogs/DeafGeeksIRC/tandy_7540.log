16:59 -!- Irssi: Starting query in DeafGeeksIRC with Tandy|7540
17:00 <`> server irc.retro-box.net
17:00 <`> user retrobox
17:00 <`> password 52jlh762l45kj67h2l
17:01 <Tandy|7540> sweet
17:02 <`> unreal is already compiled in ~/Unreal3.2
17:02 <`> just drop in your configs
17:02 <`> and ./unreal start
17:03 <Tandy|7540> sweet
17:03 <Tandy|7540> holy fuck long password is long
17:03 <`> you should be able to copypasta
17:03 <Tandy|7540> yup
17:03  * Tandy|7540 looks up how to change passwords
17:03 <`> otherwise, you can passwd
17:03 <Tandy|7540> ya
17:03 <`> just ssh in
17:03 <`> and execute
17:03 <`> passwd
17:03 <`> it'll then ask you for existing, then new pass twice
17:04 <`> and
17:04 <`> on a linux system
17:04  * Tandy|7540 drops in his unreal shit
17:04 <`> you can do ssh-copy-id
17:04 <`> so you dont have to give a password.
17:04 <`> ever.
17:04 <`> fucking windows.
17:04 <Tandy|7540> lol
17:04 <`> linux is fucking win
17:04 <Tandy|7540> it's easier to use windows
17:04 <Tandy|7540> }:A
17:04 <Tandy|7540> yeah
17:04 <`> not for me.
17:04 <Tandy|7540> thus the reason it's installing on the shuttle
17:04 <Tandy|7540> no
17:04 <Tandy|7540> I mean
17:04 <Tandy|7540> it's easier to use windows than to fornicate
17:04 <`> windows actually frustrates me.
17:04 <Tandy|7540> with it
17:05 <`> i CANNOT use it in my workflow
17:05 <`> i HAVE TO HAVE A COMMANDLINE FOR FUCKS SAKE
17:05 <`> i.e.
17:05 <Tandy|7540> lol
17:05 <`> on windows, i'd go hey, i need to look up this
17:05 <`> and then >mfw no fucking terminal
17:05 <Tandy|7540> haw
17:05 <`> then grunt and groan, and pull up PuTTY, configure it, etc
17:06 <`> when on linux, one fucking button, COMMAND FUCKING LINE
17:06 <`> ......fucking windows
17:06 <Tandy|7540> one button?
17:06 <`> yeah
17:06 <Tandy|7540> which button is this?
17:06 <`> i add the terminal button to the panel
17:06 <Tandy|7540> oh
17:06 <`> so *mouse over* *click*
17:06 <`> done.
17:07 <Tandy|7540> >he uses a mouse
17:07 <`> i use my keyboard
17:07 <Tandy|7540> :P
17:07 <`> more than my mouse
17:07 <`> but i digress.
17:07 <`> i also use gnome-do
17:07 <`> CTRL SPACE, term, ENTER
17:07 <Tandy|7540> gnome-do is amazing
17:08 <`> yeah
17:09 <`> i configured it to use ctrl space
17:09 <`> so its just a quick ctrlspace and type in the first few letters, enter
17:09 <`> all done :D
17:09 <Tandy|7540> eyup :D
17:09 <Tandy|7540> I think there's a windows app similar to that
17:09 <`> there is.
17:09 <`> launchpad?
17:09 <`> cant really remember the name of it
17:10 <`> on OS X, it's Quicksilver (most popular) and Alfred
17:10 <`> http://alfredapp.com/
17:12  * ` sets connection irc.retro-box.net
17:12 <Tandy|7540> it's called Launchy
17:12 <Tandy|7540> sets connection?
17:12 <`> so it will continually try to connect
17:12 <`> until it does.
17:12 <Tandy|7540> oh
17:12 <Tandy|7540> lol
17:12 <`> or until i do /rmreconns
17:12 <`> so what're you doing with it?
17:12 <Tandy|7540> fun
17:13 <Tandy|7540> copying my crap over
17:13 <Tandy|7540> Too lazy to find the configs
17:13 <`> ?
17:13 <Tandy|7540> I just copied the whole damn /Unreal3.2 folder
17:13 <`> .....
17:13 <Tandy|7540> I'm regretting that decision... it's taking bloody ages
17:13 <`> tell me you didn't overwrite
17:13 <Tandy|7540> erm...
17:13 <`> fuck.
17:13 <Tandy|7540> that fucks stuff up?
17:13 <`> now it needs to be recompiled.
17:13 <Tandy|7540> well shit
17:13 <Tandy|7540> laziness = more work generated
17:13 <`> just stop it
17:14 <Tandy|7540> done
17:14 <`> and pick out all .conf files in your Unreal3.2
17:14  * Tandy|7540 untars the unreal tarball in his home directory
17:14  * Tandy|7540 prepares to compile dat shit
17:14 <`> wait
17:14 <Tandy|7540> watnao
17:15 <`> i'm already in lol
17:15 <Tandy|7540> oh god what the hell have I done
17:15 <`> but if you want to recompile, be my guest
17:15 <Tandy|7540> I untar'd it
