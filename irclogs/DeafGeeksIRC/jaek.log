21:50 <`> gimme a oline on your ircd
21:50 <`> :D
21:53 <Jaek> my server's down :/
21:54 <Jaek> I would, tho
21:54 <Jaek> but I don't even have one :P
21:55 <`> lolwat
21:55 <`> what happened to it
21:55 <Jaek> power outage accidentally my Unreal and mysql servers
21:55 <Jaek> the database files are intact
21:55 <Jaek> as well as the unreal configs
21:56 <Jaek> but it all got fucked royal
21:56 <Jaek> couldn't get either to start again
21:56 <`> so just lemme get at it
21:56 <Jaek> were complaining of not enough disk space but >mfw 30gb free
21:56 <Jaek> meh
21:56 <`> so backup the relevant shit
21:56 <Jaek> I'm gonna reinstall debian tomorrow, upgrade to the latest version while I'm at it
21:56 <`> renuke with debian
21:56 <`> yeah.
21:56 <Jaek> then just recompile unreal
21:56 <Jaek> moving the website to the company server
21:56 <`> "company server"?
21:57 <Jaek> since we have a lot of pictures on the forum and >loading pictures from a 40kbps connection
21:57 <`> i should setup xen on one of my more powerful machines
21:57 <`> and give you a VM for servan
21:57 <`> want?
21:59 <Jaek> i dunno
21:59 <Jaek> somanychoices.png
21:59 <Jaek> what're your server's specs?
21:59 <`> no idea yet.
22:01 <Jaek> lol
22:01 <Jaek> advantage of that would be I'd get shell access
22:01 <Jaek> which would be neato
22:01 <Jaek> unless I do something stupid like I did on my windows server when I enabled automatic backups every night and filled up the hard drive in about two days.
22:02 <Jaek> <dustin> WHUR THE FUCK DID MY HDD SPACE GO?!
22:02 <`> lol
22:02 <`> this would be on an isolated machine
22:03 <`> as in, you can do whatever the fuck you wanted.
22:03 <`> short of doing some illegal shit, like HURRDURRIMMAHACK
22:05 <Jaek> lol
22:06 <Jaek> torrent proxy?
22:06  * Jaek runs
22:06 <`> lol
22:06 <`> i'm already doing a seedbox already
22:06 <`> so err
22:07 <Jaek> hah
22:07 <Jaek> k
22:07 <Jaek> hmm
22:07 <Jaek> I'll think on it
22:07 <Jaek> see if what I'm doing now will work
22:09 <`> kk

00:01 <`> i need to know your DNS info
00:01 <`> nameservers, to be precise.
00:01 <Jaek> pff
00:01 <Jaek> I haven't the slightest idea
00:02 <`> because i seem to remember either one of you guys had me switch DNS to someone else's
00:02 <`> by either one of you, i mean you and sean
00:02 <`> and i just did a mass update in my admin backend
00:02 <`> went oh shit
00:03 <Jaek> I have no idea how my domain is set up, to be perfectly honest
00:03 <Jaek> I know binki manages part of it
00:03 <Jaek> I tell him when I need a subdomain redirected or something
00:03 <`> then that's the thing
00:03 <`> i need his nameserver info
00:03 <`> otherwise retrobox is dead in the water
00:03 <`> :|
00:04 <`> so get him to grab info, so i can input it and sort it all out.
00:04 <Jaek> I just highlighted him in #retrobox
00:05 <Jaek> but we'll see if he's awake
00:08 <`> okies

13:34 <Jaek> haha, ok
13:34 <Jaek> noone even noticed the domain was borked
13:34 <Jaek> that's how important it is :P
13:35 <`> :P
13:36 <`> tho the irc.retro-box.net would be dead
13:36 <Jaek> yeah
13:36 <Jaek> but noone ever logs off there
13:37 <`> haha, yeah, well
13:37 <`> better safe then sorry
13:37 <Jaek> yep
13:37 <Jaek> I need to get the HTTPd back up
13:37 <`> :P
13:37 <Jaek> the server is sitting in my basement ._.
13:37 <`> or just power it up in the basement
13:37 <`> (unless it's dusty as fuck)
13:38 <Jaek> it needs Debian reinstalled on it
13:38 <Jaek> and I need to rehash the site a bit
13:38 <`> yeah
13:38 <`> beige-box.com is actually decent
13:39 <Jaek> it is
13:39 <Jaek> I wonder what linuxlove used to make that
13:39 <Jaek> the background is... huge, though
13:39 <`> looks like
13:39 <`> handmade
13:39 <Jaek> it's just kind amateurish to open a site and have the background sit there and load
13:39 <`> the code is fucking clean
13:39 <Jaek> I didn't know sean was that good with html
13:39 <Jaek> it is
13:40 <Jaek> wait
13:40 <Jaek> wtf
13:40 <`> i kinda forced him to handwrite his first beige-box.com site
13:40 <Jaek> erm
13:40 <`> that may be why
13:40 <Jaek> the hell
13:40 <Jaek> I just went to look at the code again
13:40 <Jaek> it's just an iframe
13:40 <Jaek> ...what on earth is going on here
13:40 <`> yes
13:40 <`> iframe to www.*
13:40 <`> we need to fix that
13:40 <Jaek> ...why
13:40 <Jaek> yeah, no kidding
13:40 <`> cheapass forwarding
13:40 <Jaek> aaah
13:41  * Jaek view frame source
13:41 <Jaek> wow
13:41 <`> i can forward to www in DNS
13:41 <Jaek> that's some compact code
13:41 <`> yeah
13:41 <`> he even validated it
13:41 <`> damn. he's got better.
13:41 <Jaek> no kidding
13:42 <Jaek> I validate my code and the W3C is like NIGGA WHUT
13:42 <Jaek> >tables, tables everywhere
13:42 <Jaek> I haven't learned how to use div tags and such
13:42 <`> either that
13:42 <`> or he had help:
13:42 <`> http://www.beige-box.com/about.php
13:42 <`> note: all of the shit is in PHP
13:43 <`> which means he's probably using <?php include(); ?> code
13:43 <`> to easily update shit
13:43 <Jaek> I have no idea what that means
13:43 <Jaek> is that so he can change body text and such without editing the html itself?
13:43 <`> i.e. header.php; body_$PAGE.php; footer.php
13:44 <Jaek> or change the menu in one file and it updates globally?
13:44 <`> all included into index.php with that include();
13:44 <`> edit that one file
13:44 <Jaek> because I am so sick if manually editing the menu for EVERY PAGE ON MY FRIGGEN SITE
13:44 <`> and it affects the whole thing
13:44 <Jaek> dude
13:44 <Jaek> I need that
13:44 <Jaek> inside me
13:44 <`> lol
13:44 <`> EDUCATION TIEM
13:44 <Jaek> WHOO
13:44 <`> bring up your damn httpd
13:44 <`> :D
13:44 <Jaek> yep
13:44 <Jaek> I'm about to go slap debian on a PIII
13:45 <Jaek> >running a server over wifi
13:45 <Jaek> unfortunately, I have to
13:45 <Jaek> yep, linuxlove coded all that himself, more or less
13:45 <Jaek> just went on the w3c schools site and educated himself
13:46 <`> holy hell
13:46 <`> he's even using git!
13:46 <Jaek> wat
13:46 <`> https://github.com/LBBNetwork
13:46 <`> he's not a dumbass anymore.
13:47 <Jaek> yeah he's stopped being an immature child in my channel, finally
13:47 <`> yeah
13:49 <Jaek> meh, I'm going to go all babbymode on this server and install Crunchbang
13:49 <Jaek> less to mess with as far as configuring wireless goes
13:49 <Jaek> I can pretty much just install it and then leave and SSH into it from here
13:50  * ` points to #wtfpwnt
13:50 <`> and wicd/wicd-curses is fuckeasy to configure on the console
13:50 <`> just saying.
13:50 <Jaek> eeh, but then I have to use ethernuts to install the OS
13:51 <Jaek> and I don't feel like unplugging the PIII, dragging it over to the router, grabbing a monitor, mouse, keyboard, installing the OS, configuring wicd, then dragging it back
13:51 <Jaek> the only downside of crunchbang is it has X running by default
13:54 <`> or just shove it running under your bed? :P
13:57 <Jaek> lol
13:59 <Jaek> load it with porn
13:59 <Jaek> PORN UNDER MAH BED
