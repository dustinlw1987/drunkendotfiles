09:14 <`> i didnt have enough, so paypal tried twice, hence the weird EFT Paypal bullshit. lol
09:14 <tidux|sdf> cool
09:14 <`> but yeah, that's the simple dashboard
09:14 <`> i <3 it
09:14 <`> how's it going?
09:15 <tidux|sdf> logging in to my current ebanking site to do a transfer
09:16 <`> nice.
09:16 <`> iirc i was able to bypass that step because lol no $ at the time
09:16 <`> but might as well do it now, link the two, etc
09:18 <tidux|sdf> aw fuck I need checks to do that
09:18 <tidux|sdf> never mind
09:18 <tidux|sdf> I'll do it later

09:27 <tidux|sdf> wait, fuck this noise
09:28 <tidux|sdf> it'd cost me $20 to transfer $100
09:28 <tidux|sdf> :|
09:28 <tidux|sdf> that's on my end, not Simple's end
09:29 <tidux|sdf> how long does it take for the card to show up?
09:29 <tidux|sdf> if it's not here by the 10th it's worthless
09:29 <tidux|sdf> >movoing
09:29 <tidux|sdf> >non-refundable tickets

10:34 <`> oh god
10:34 <`> sorry
10:35 <`> ...fucking reddit
10:35 <`> tidux|sdf: and you CAN forward mail
10:36 <tidux|sdf> I don't know where I'm going yet
10:36 <`> just have someone black out the old address, mark "MOVED" with the new address and give to mailman
10:36 <tidux|sdf> hard to forward mail to an address that doesn't exist
10:36 <tidux|sdf> also that's my mom's house I listed so she's all WUT
10:36 <`> hm
10:36 <`> well, it should arrive relatively quickly.
10:36 <tidux|sdf> ok
10:36 <tidux|sdf> that's good
10:39 <tidux|sdf> as long as it arrives by a week from tomorrow I'm good
