20:50 <tidux> people were actually asking for that
20:50 <`> no shit
20:50 <tidux> and I made sure it was on a one-time loop
20:50 <`> yup
20:51 <tidux> oh well, we can always delink irc.rubbermallet.org and make our own network with blackjack and hookers
20:51 <tidux> you, erik, sudos, and me if I ever get unrealircd compiled
20:51 <`> sudos, lol
20:51 <`> will not happen

20:58 <`> seems hes still intent on removing your oline
20:58 <tidux> I can't believe I'm the first one to combine a for loop, cat, and a directory full of ASCII/ANSI art
20:58 <tidux> ` well unless he edits Erik's server config he can't do shit
20:58 <`> yeah
20:58 <`> he's trying to find erik
20:59 <tidux> hoo boy
20:59 <tidux> well he's not gonna do it in #opers
20:59 <tidux> since I'm joined there

20:59 <tidux> oh noes mike is whoising me
