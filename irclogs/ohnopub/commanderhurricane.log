18:34 -!- Irssi: Starting query in ohnopub with CommanderHurricane
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> link ohnopublishing.net
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> {
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> username *;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> hostname ohnopublishing.net;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> bind-ip *; 
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> port 6697;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> hub *;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> password-connect *;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> password-receive "ohnopublishing.net.cert.perm" { sslclientcert; };
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> class servers;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> options {
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> ssl;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> autoconnect;
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> };
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> /this is what my linkblock looks like
18:34 <`> link ohnopublishing.net { username                *; hostname                ohnopublishing.net; bind-ip                 *; port                    6697; hub                     *; password-connect        *; password-receive        "unrealircd_ohnopublishing.net_cert.pem" { sslclient$ class servers; options { autoconnect; ssl; nohostcheck; };
18:34 <`> };
18:34 <`> for some reason, it doesnt do linebreaks
18:34  * ` shrugs
18:34 <CommanderHurricane> interesting. very interesting.
18:35 <`> here's a screenshot, actually
18:35 <`> http://cl.ly/1m1V3k3F2o1b0L0d0n1r
18:37 <`> the drpass line i removed prior to screenshot
18:37 <CommanderHurricane> only difference i can see is that i don't have the nohostcheck flag set in my block
18:37 <`> yeah
18:37 <`> lets see if i can kill off that option
18:37 <`> and see what happens
18:38 <`> nope
18:38 <`> it's all LOLNOEP
18:42 <`> even if i changed it to ohnopub.net
