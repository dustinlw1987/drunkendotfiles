18:12 < Mariorulez14> ...Oh my God, I have found something that could quite possibly rival the greatness that is a Borderlands/MLP crossover
18:12 < Mariorulez14> An ARTEMIS FOWL/MLP crossover
18:12 < `> oh god
18:12  * Mariorulez14 fangasms and clicks
18:12 < `> i love artemis fowl

18:18 < `> i haven't read the latest artemis fowl books
18:18 < `> the last one, i remember, the cover was red
18:19 < `> and i also heard that
18:19 < `> they're trying to make an Artemis Fowl movie
18:19 < `> which i'm really looking forward to
18:20 < `> yeah
18:20 < `> the last book i read was AF: The Lost Colony
18:20 < `> where Artemis came back when everyone was older, including Butler
18:20 < `> i was like, wow, really humanizing.
18:26 < Mariorulez14> Oh god, where he was gone for like 7 years in the demon realm?
18:26 < Mariorulez14> Yeah :/
18:26 < Mariorulez14> If I remember correctly, there's I think one more book after that one
18:26 < Mariorulez14> 2, nevermind
18:26 < Mariorulez14> Unless they wrote another one
18:28 < Mariorulez14> I had the sneaking suspicion that the Artemis Fowl crossover would be drivel
18:28 < Mariorulez14> Turns out it was

18:55 < Mariorulez14> IF it's just 98% done
18:55 < Mariorulez14> Does that mean what's already been downloaded is viewable if I cancel?
18:56 < Mariorulez14> The Deadpool stuff was like the first 60%
18:56 < `> sometimes it will have missing slices of data
18:56 < `> rendering it unusable
18:56 < `> so you'll have to pretty much torrent it all

20:33 < Mariorulez14> Sometimes assorted other things
20:33 < Mariorulez14> But just because we watch ponies and he doesn't, he sees it as "exclusion" because we don't like the same things
20:34 < CommanderHurricane> http://alicehumansacrifice1.deviantart.com/art/Dusk-Shine-WP-286983788
20:34 < CommanderHurricane> what
20:34 < CommanderHurricane> also Shadowfan16 is insane
20:34 < Darman213> He can whine about his exclusion to his friggin mother who cages his manhood
20:34 < Darman213> -_-
20:34 < Mariorulez14> s/insane/Aspergers
20:34 < Tandy|7540> that dude
20:34 < Mariorulez14> For Celestia's sake, he put dry ice IN  A COMPLETELY FULL OF KOOL-AID CONTAINER
20:34 < Tandy|7540> would fit in SO WELL on /b/
20:35 < Tandy|7540> or /g/
20:35 < Mariorulez14> THINKING IT WOULDN'T OVERFLOW
20:35 < CommanderHurricane> lol wut
20:35 < Mariorulez14> Actually 
20:35 < Mariorulez14> He's too sheltered for 4chan
20:35 < Mariorulez14> He'd probably be mentally scarred from all the d*cks
20:35 < Mariorulez14> And the goar threads
20:35  * Mariorulez14 goes back to reading his MythBusters parody
20:35 < Tandy|7540> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/ponychan-brony-changes-his-legal-name.html
20:35 < Tandy|7540> what fuck
20:36 < Mariorulez14> Oh, this is the guy that changed his name to Rainbow Dash
20:36 < CommanderHurricane> >letters are R.A.D
20:36 < Mariorulez14> Didn't even have to click the link XD
20:37 < Mariorulez14> So guys
20:37 < Mariorulez14> In the pony version of MythBusters, Pinkie Pie is an explosives expert after a mishap with hydrogen balloons, static electricity and a silo at her family's Rock Farm
20:37 < CommanderHurricane> http://meandmypie.deviantart.com/art/Twi-motei-246437765?q=gallery%3Amlpfriendshipismagic%2F30892825&qo=2070
20:37 < Mariorulez14> Thus driving the "Pinkie is best pony" stake in further
20:38 < Tandy|7540>  Scootles McGee
20:38 < Tandy|7540>  Scootles McGee
20:38 < Tandy|7540>  Scootles McGee
20:38 < Tandy|7540>  Scootles McGee
20:38 < Mariorulez14> She had 300mg of nitrogycerin in her saddlebags
20:38 < Mariorulez14> WH4T N0W
20:38 < Compgeke> back all
20:38 < CommanderHurricane> http://joeyh3.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Sparkle-Thrown-Back-252369431
20:38 < CommanderHurricane> heh
20:39 < Tandy|7540> changing your legal name to "Steven Magnet" would be the best goddamn thing ever
20:39 < Tandy|7540> middle name "Miracle"
20:39 < Tandy|7540> Steven Miracle Magnet
20:39 < Tandy|7540> Need a miracle? Miracle's my middle name.
20:39 < Mariorulez14> What's that from?
20:39 < Tandy|7540> ...
20:39 < Mariorulez14> Also, you spelled it wrong
20:40 < Tandy|7540> oh. That's how it's being spelled on ponychan
20:40 < Mariorulez14> It'd be Steven mIrAcLe Magnet
20:40 < Mariorulez14> Because bucking magnets...how do they work?
20:40 < Mariorulez14> The answer? mOtHeRfUcKiN mIrAcLeS
20:41 < Tandy|7540> If he were to change back after he would need to get a new license since it's information has to match his current information. 
20:41 < Tandy|7540> Overall, it could affect your ability to be hired. I would probably hold a normal first name, and change the last one. 
20:41 < Tandy|7540> I mean, I've contemplated a few crazy names: 
20:41 < Tandy|7540> Ganon Slayer, Thor McNinja but I wouldn't go through with them, not until I go to receive a doctorate later in my education. 
20:41 < Tandy|7540> Because come on, Dr. Thor McNinja.

20:44 < `> }:A
20:45 < CommanderHurricane> well i'm bored
20:45 < `> call the 909 939 7002 DID
20:45 < `> it's much more smoother without the lag/GA
20:45 < Mariorulez14> If you're bored, you should read the fic I posted
20:45 < Mariorulez14> Chocolate milk is explosive
20:45 < `> actually
20:45 < `> i'll call
20:45 < `> }:A
20:46 < `> shall I, CommanderHurricane?
20:46 < CommanderHurricane> don't make it too long
20:47 < Mariorulez14> Oooooooh my sweeeet everythiiiiing
20:47 < Mariorulez14> Ellis from Left 4 Dead 2 + Ponies
20:47 < Mariorulez14> YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYES
20:48 < `> CommanderHurricane: how was it?
20:48 < `> much better, right?
20:48 < CommanderHurricane> `: alright
20:48 < CommanderHurricane> yes
20:48 < `> the other call
20:48 < `> literally uses Video Relay
20:48  * CommanderHurricane adds number into contact list
20:48 < `> where the operator sees me and translates my sign language in realtime
20:49 < `> but the first call was via text relay, where they have to listen to you talk, type it, send it to me, then i have to type my response, send it
20:49 < `> with GO AHEAD, etc
20:49 < CommanderHurricane> i see
20:49 < Mariorulez14> Well goldangit
20:49 < Mariorulez14> The torrent's still stuck at 98%
20:49 < Mariorulez14> Wat do
20:49 < CommanderHurricane> well i now have the 939 number in my phone
20:49 < `> i typically use text relay most of the time when dealing with companies, IVRs, etc
20:49 < `> but with friends/family, video relay :)
20:49 < CommanderHurricane> so now when you let the dns server domain lapse, i can call you up and fuss at you :P
20:49 < `> you can see about vidrelay http://convorelay.com/
20:50 < `> CommanderHurricane: lawl, will not happen again
20:50 < `> CommanderHurricane: i actually regained deafgeeks.net/org back
20:50 < CommanderHurricane> so how's the 939-7002 number set up
20:51 < `> well
20:51 < `> it's a video-based SIP
20:51 < `> a form of VoIP but with video.
20:51 < `> and i use a program on my computer
20:51 < `> here, let me show you.
20:52 < Tandy|7540> wafflebutt
20:52 < Mariorulez14> Tandy
20:52 < CommanderHurricane> shut up
20:52 < `> http://cl.ly/2d1t0x1n3T3R3z2e3V1V
20:52 < Tandy|7540> YOUR HAIR IS GODDAMN FABULOUS
20:52 < `> a real, live snapshot of my "phone"
20:52 < `> Tandy|7540: i know, right
20:53 < Tandy|7540> lol
20:53 < Mariorulez14> Rarity would be most pleased with that hair
20:53 < CommanderHurricane> ` so that's pretty neat stuff
20:53 < `> CommanderHurricane: very
20:53 < `> CommanderHurricane: with the other #
20:53 < `> it's all setup via AIM
20:53 < Mariorulez14> Man, the best part about fanfics based off of games I own is the ability to supply background music and sound effects as I read
20:53 < `> lemme show you what it looked like when you called me
20:54  * Mariorulez14 searches through his Left 4 Dead 2 files for assorted clips
20:54 < `> CommanderHurricane: here goes
20:54 < `> My IP Relay: The My IP Relay service has a phone call from 334-332-XXXX for you. Type your response to take this call now, or type MSG to ignore it and have the relay operator take a message for you instead.
20:54 < `> Dustin Williams: yes sir qq ga
20:54 < `> My IP Relay: IP RELAY RO80953F WITH A CALL
20:55 < `> then after that is basically a log of the call
20:55 < CommanderHurricane> i see
20:55 < `> nod.
20:55 < `> i x'd out the last 4 digits so people here wont be crankcalling you and all
20:55 < `> }:A
20:56 < CommanderHurricane> }:A
20:56 < `> theres a whole terminology that goes into a text relay call
20:56 < `> GA: Go ahead
20:56 < `> QQ: Question mark
20:57 < `> SKSK: Stop keying, stop keying (Hang Up)
20:57 < `> GA TO SK: Go ahead, but ready to stop keying (ready to hangup)
20:57 < `> etc
20:57 < CommanderHurricane> sounds complex, but i imagine you memorize all the terms once you use it enough
20:57 < `> actually
20:58 < `> it's really easy
20:58 < `> it's like saying "over" on radio
20:58 < `> hi ga
20:58 < `> what's up qq ga
20:58 < CommanderHurricane> fair enough
20:58 < `> not much ga
20:58 < `> etc
20:58 < `> and when ready to hangup
20:58 < `> i say
20:58 < `> hey, gotta go ga to sk
20:58 < `> etc

21:10 < Mariorulez14> Mower blade wounds over 95% of his body...and I didn't run him over, either! He somehow managed to fall under his own!
21:11 < CommanderHurricane> why would you leave the lawnmower blade on
21:12 < Mariorulez14> >ellis gets apple-bucked right in the nethers
21:12 < Mariorulez14> Man, even getting Charger'd into a wall can't compare to that kind of pain
21:13 < Mariorulez14> " The creature howled, its voice rising at least three or four octaves.  I collapsed to the ground in front of the orange-colored earth pony, groaning and writhing in agony.  Applejack stood over it, berating its behavior."
21:13 < Mariorulez14> lololol
21:13 < Mariorulez14>         “Uh... you all right there?  Ah didn’t mean tah hurt you that bad.”  She spoke softly.
21:13 < Mariorulez14>         It gave an exhausted chuckle, pain laced through its voice.  “That’s all right.  Ah figured ah didn’t need kids anyway...”
21:13 < Mariorulez14> Oh god the lulz

22:01 <~RainbowDash> Not really, no.
22:01 < Mariorulez14> Be honeeest
22:01 <~RainbowDash> I am being honest.
22:01 < Mariorulez14> lol
22:01 < Mariorulez14> Regardless, this story's awesome
22:02 < Mariorulez14> Zombies, Dash
22:02 < Mariorulez14> ZOMBIES
22:02 <~RainbowDash> Zombies. Riiiight. I'll have to tell that one to Spike.
22:03 < Mariorulez14> No, I'm serious
22:03 < Mariorulez14> Ellis is from a game where the sole purpose is to survive a zombie apocalypse
22:03 < Mariorulez14> One of the best games ever ,3
22:03 <~RainbowDash> OK, it's a game. It's not real, and I've certainly never seen a zombie pony before.
22:04 < Mariorulez14> Not zombie ponies...zombie PEOPLE
22:04 < Tandy|7540> I dunno.... Twilight in the mornings...
22:04 < Mariorulez14> Well, I guess you can't call the exception of 7 types "people" anymore :/
22:05 < Tandy|7540> I don't know about you ponies, but that's as close to a 'zombie pony' as I want to get.
22:05 < Mariorulez14> Chicks that spit acid and little crazy ones that ride on your head and pull you away
22:05 < Mariorulez14> Here Dash, give it a read http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Infected
22:05 < CommanderHurricane> Tandy|7540 come on, twilight isn't *that* horrible in the morning
22:06 < Mariorulez14> OOOOOOOOOOH
22:06 <~RainbowDash> Mariorulez14, sounds like bad stuff... Thankfully it's all fiction.
22:06 < Mariorulez14> Yeah...the creepy thing is that it could actually happen
22:07 <~RainbowDash> Really?
22:09 < Tandy|7540> CommanderHurricane: Okay, maybe not Twilight, but Luna is absolutely *Horrible* in the mornings if she doesn't get her coffee.
22:09 < Tandy|7540> Take this from somepony who knows
22:09 < Tandy|7540> Woah, whoops
22:09 -!- Tandy|7540 is now known as Azurite

22:10 < Azurite> Hah.
22:10 < Azurite> I dunno about her sister. She generally stays in her chambers when she's not in the throne room. I imagine she's not exactly a ball of sunshine in the morning, either.
22:11 < CommanderHurricane> >luna
22:11 < CommanderHurricane> >not exactly a ball of sunshine
22:11 < CommanderHurricane> i see what you did there

16:45 < Mariorulez14> That torrent finished around 5 AM
16:45 <~RainbowDash> Lyra... Yeah, she's pretty obsessed with hands. It drives Bon-Bon up the wall sometimes.
16:46 < Mariorulez14> What caused this strange obsession with ze hands?
16:47 < CommanderHurricane> scootaloo must be pretty strong to carry a wagon filled with two fillies, 6 planks of wood, 4x8 plywood, a box of nails, cans of paint, 4 brushes, a fan and a bunch of fabric

16:48 < Mariorulez14> I got cliffhangered in a Lyra-Ellis chase
16:49 <~RainbowDash> I don't exactly know, but I think it started when Lyra was trying some sort of "viewer" spell to let her see things from other places.
16:49 <~RainbowDash> Like I said, I don't exactly know all the details.
16:50 < Mariorulez14> What kind of pony would give someone as unstable as Lyra a viewer spell

17:56 < Mariorulez14> OK, let's see
17:56 < Mariorulez14> With so many antibiotics available and thousands and thousands of drug studies published it's difficult to know what antibiotics to use.  This is where practice guidelines come in handy.  Practice guidelines are published by medical societies who specialize in treating a specific type of disease.

02:14 < Compgeke> but I am
02:15 < `> ._____________.
02:15 < `> ok, but i'm getting stoned, though.
02:15 < Compgeke> what time is it there?
02:15 < `> fair warning.
02:15 < Compgeke> 12:15 AM here
02:15 < `> 0015
02:15 < Compgeke> :D
02:15 < Compgeke> same time :D
02:15 < `> server's in DFW, though, so it says 0215
02:15 < Compgeke> hmm
02:15 < Compgeke> just torrented some stuff on Linux
02:16 < Compgeke> copied it to Windows
02:16 < Compgeke> and it had a virus xD
02:16 < Compgeke> I should stop torrenting on Linux
02:16 < `> lol no
02:16 < `> torrent it on linux
02:16 < `> run everything through clamav
02:16 < Compgeke> hmm...good idea
02:16 < `> that way
02:17 < `> nothing touches your windows machines without a onceover by an antivirus engine
02:17 < `> :P
02:17 < Compgeke> I get rid of everything
02:17  * Compgeke waits for a Linux virus
02:17 < `> lols.
02:17 < Compgeke> although the linux comminuty is smart enough to write a fix to whatever virus someone may right before it really affects anyone
02:17 < `> clamav scans for everything
02:18 < `> win AND linux
02:18 < `> and you're right
02:18 < `> patches are near-instant on linux
02:18 < `> but windows? months to years.
02:18 < `> which is bullshit.
02:18 < Compgeke> there are like 10 updates a day on Linux, which makes me feel better that there are fixes to problems
02:18 < Compgeke> not "you have a problem, go phuck off"
02:18 < `> exactly.
02:19 < Compgeke> the cat is shedding D:

02:20 < Compgeke> :D
02:20 < Compgeke> no camera here...
02:20 < `> :P
02:21 < `> the canon strap that's otensibly in the picture
02:21 < `> actually belongs to my Rebel SLR
02:21 < `> :P
02:21 < Compgeke> I do have a camera...
02:21 < Compgeke> it's also an SLR (not D-SLR)
02:21 < `> yeah
02:21 < `> you told me at one time
02:21 < `> a canon film SLR
02:21 < Compgeke> Canon Rebel EOS 2000, 35mm, with an 80-200 crap lens
02:22 < `> yeah, i remember
02:22 < Compgeke> I'm using all the cheap ISO800 film I got at a yardsale lol
02:22 < `> EOS Digital Rebel XSi
02:22 < Compgeke> D:
02:22 < Compgeke> I want a digita
02:22 < Compgeke> digital*
02:22 < `> this one uses SD cards
02:22 < Compgeke> as I would be able to see what I take lol
02:22 < Compgeke> film is expensive to develop
02:22 < Compgeke> so I just throw the film in a box when I'm done
02:24 < `> heh
02:24 < `> i would actually love a film camera
02:24 < `> but definitely not SLR
02:25 < `> a oldie, probably
02:25 < `> to give it that '60s-'70s look
02:25 < `> hell, 50s-70s
02:25 < Compgeke> lol
02:25 < Compgeke> I want my mom's old SLR
02:25 < Compgeke> it's an old Minolta XG-1
02:26 < Compgeke> with a 30-300mm Macro lens...not sure what you would be doing with macro that you need the distance of 300mm though lol
02:26 < Compgeke> that's a good distance away
02:26 < Compgeke> zooming 400 feet?
02:28 < `> heh
02:28 < Compgeke> however, it has a scratched mirror :(
02:28 < `> oh, ouch!
02:28 < `> those are expensive to replace
02:28 < Compgeke> yeah, where do you get those fixed anyways?
02:28 < `> specialty camera shops if the manufacturer wont do it
02:29 < Compgeke> I also have just what you want, a Yashica MG-1?
02:29 < Compgeke> yeah, a MG-1
02:29 < Compgeke> perfect example of 70s 
02:29 < Compgeke> so...japanese
02:29 < `> oh god
02:29 < `> i want that
02:29 < Compgeke> http://spb.fotolog.com/photo/43/54/57/mehibi/1244646403740_f.jpg
02:29 < `> NO BATTERIES REQUIRED
02:30 < Compgeke> it does actually
02:30 < `> unless you used the CdS metering
02:30 < `> otherwise, nope.
02:30 < Compgeke> but not for the shutter
02:30 < Compgeke> only for over\under exposure lights
02:30 < `> like i said, CdS metering
02:30 < `> :)
02:30 < Compgeke> my mom has a lot of cameras
02:30 < `> http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/CdS
02:30 < Compgeke> I have my Rebel, that's about it
02:31 < `> but yeah, i'd love to get my hands on one of those. :P
02:31 < Compgeke> some broken Canon digital Po\a)S (Piece of Shit and Point and Shoot)
02:31 < `> heh
02:32 < Compgeke> not sure where my mom get her stuff
02:32 < `> i have a broken SD200
02:32 < Compgeke> mine is...I really don't remember
02:32 < `> a Canon POS, that is.
02:32 < Compgeke> it's a 3 MP
02:32 < Compgeke> takes CF cards
02:32 < `> http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Yashica_MG-1
02:32 < `> looks nifty.
02:32 < Compgeke> the CCD has a loose cable
02:34 < Compgeke> http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/719/dsc00091ii.jpg
02:35 < Compgeke> the 70s looking ones all need cleaned
02:35 < Compgeke> a flood does wonders to a camera
02:35 < Compgeke> the XG-1 is the bottom right one (love that one)
02:35 < Compgeke> this was before I had a lens for the rebel
02:36 < `> oh wow!
02:36 < `> i'd love at least one of those minoltas
02:36 < `> the older ones
02:36 < Compgeke> lol
02:36 < Compgeke> I can't do anything really
02:36 < Compgeke> they're my moms
02:36 < Compgeke> except the rebel
02:36 < Compgeke> that's mine (and my only working camera)
02:37 < Compgeke> wait, no
02:37 < Compgeke> I have a Sony MiniDV camera
02:37 < `> lol
02:37 < Compgeke> takes crappy quality video, but at least is something
02:37 < Compgeke> I used to have a Canon great MiniDV camera
02:37 < Compgeke> I haven't seen that since my neighbor moved in (and he has been known to steal stuff)
02:38 < Compgeke> I was going to buy a charger for it eventually...what the heck was the model?
02:38 < `> what a bastard
02:38 < Compgeke> if he did take it I hope he has fun
02:38 < `> >move in
02:38 < `> >known thief
02:39 < Compgeke> the battery was completely shot, the previous owner had reversed the battery to try and get it to charge and fried the charger AND battery
02:39 < `> >wtf are you thinking
02:39 < Compgeke> he moved in after us
02:39 < Compgeke> we're moving anyways...FINALLY
02:39 < `> wait
02:39 < `> whats this place?
02:39 < `> a halfass townhome or something?
02:39 < Compgeke> Napa, CA
02:40 < Compgeke> everything is so freaking expensive here
02:40 < Compgeke> and that particular house scares me
02:40 < `> oh, "roommate"
02:40 < `> is what you meant?
02:40 < Compgeke> when we moved in they did a drug bust there D:
02:40 < `> whoa.
02:40 < Compgeke> it's our next door house
02:40 < `> ah.
02:40 < Compgeke> scared the shit out of us when you have the guns coming...
02:40 < `> they busted your house, or?
02:40 < Compgeke> no
02:40 < Compgeke> asked if we knew where the people lived
02:40 < Compgeke> and we knew they were selling drugs
02:41 < Compgeke> not everyone gets 5 minte vistors at 3 AM
02:41 < `> ooo
02:41 < `> ok
02:41 < Compgeke> and not everyone brought a whole car in on a truck
02:41 < `> i had an literal FBI raid
02:41 < Compgeke> and had it leave that night in parts
02:41 < `> a few years ago
02:41 < Compgeke> DEA is who I believe came
02:42 < `> apparently a hacker lived at the townhome before I
02:42 < Compgeke> LOL
02:42 < `> now, me being a sysadmin
02:42 < `> I HAD A HELL OF A TIME
02:42 < Compgeke> made that a fun converstation
02:42 < `> proving that I wasn't the dude
02:42 < Compgeke> fun for me...
02:42 < Compgeke> I own a lot of servers
02:42 < Compgeke> real ones
02:42 < `> and they were halfway through processing my shit as evidence
02:43 < `> they were nice enough to help me put everything back, though
02:43 < Compgeke> they could take what they wanted
02:43 < `> right.
02:43 < Compgeke> as long as they don't break the RAID arrays of the server
02:43 < `> but they were all >mfw when they realized i was deaf
02:43 < Compgeke> the Intel 4u took me 2 hours to construct, and I don't want to reconstruct that RAID5 array
02:43 < Compgeke> LOL
02:43 < `> THEN tried to prove my ID
02:43 < `> etc
02:43 < `> took almost all day
02:43 < `> it sucked. lol
02:43 < Compgeke> they were yelling at you I suppose?
02:43 < `> no
02:44 < `> i had a special lock on my door
02:44 < Compgeke> hmm
02:44 < `> my roomies were already cleared and moved downstairs
02:44 < `> i was still passed out
02:44 < Compgeke> hmm
02:44 < `> so they jimmied my lock
02:44 < `> got in
02:44 < `> drew their weapons on me
02:44 < `> so
02:44 < Compgeke> they would have a fun time with my stuff
02:44 < `> imagine waking up to THAT
02:44 < Compgeke> I have a box of hard drives
02:44 < `> i had a literal 9mm pistol in my face
02:44 < `> when i turned over
02:44 < Compgeke> xD
02:45 < `> woke me up right quick
02:45 < `> :D
02:45 < `> but yeah
02:45 < Compgeke> I don't think you can get in my room right now
02:45 < `> lol why not
02:45 < Compgeke> I have a pile of towers in the doorway right now
02:45 < Compgeke> cleaning up to pack, so had to put them somewhere
02:45 < `> hah
02:45 < Compgeke> you can try the window, but you'll fall on the heater or a 4' drop to the floor
02:46 < Compgeke> depending on the window you choose
02:47 < `> lols
02:48 < Compgeke> if you try and steal my desktop, hope you can run with it
02:48 < Compgeke> it weighs close to 50 Lbs
02:49 < Compgeke> ahh, Canon Ultura is what I used to have
02:49 < `> heh
02:49 < `> i'd probably part it out
02:50 < `> as in grab anything that's worth anything
02:50 < Compgeke> lol
02:50 < `> RAM, etc
02:50 < Compgeke> steal the 750 gig hard drive, video card (radeon 9800 GTX+), TV Tuner, Audigy 2 ZS?
02:50 < Compgeke> GeFOrce*
02:50 < Compgeke> damn, why do I keep calling it a Radeon?
02:50 < Compgeke> a radeon 9800 would SUCK
02:54 < Compgeke> stealing my ram is useless really
02:54 < Compgeke> it's only 2x 1 GB and 2x 512 MB
02:54 < Compgeke> but I'm off to bed, night!
02:54 < Compgeke> (more like morning(
02:54 < Compgeke> )*

16:24 < Azurite> <ekduo|xe1n> A male dolphin's member is roughly S-shaped, tapered at the end. If you are in the water with them, it is best to support the dolphin on his side, just under the water, with one hand, and handle him with the other. Male dolphins, I find, tend to prefer the base of the penis to be gently massaged and squeezed, as well as gently rubbed along it's length.

17:07 < Mariorulez14> Posted this:
17:07 < Mariorulez14> Guys, seriously...we're threatening a nuclear war over the internet over someone as peaceful and kind as Derpy? She certainly wouldn't appreciate how most of you are acting.
17:07 < Mariorulez14> I'm just as upset over Derpy as the next bro, I really am (she's my 2nd-favorite pony), but I chose to be really reserved about it aside from signing the SaveDerpy.com petition. It drives me absolutely crazy that the "love and toleration" that bronies support is starting to fade into hypocrisy due to the aggressiveness of some people toward people like Yamino (seriously, what'd she even do?), not to mention the creators of
17:07 < Mariorulez14>  the show we all watch and love. If the soccer-moms won and Derpy gets her name changed, that's just an example of how "life isn't fair", as parents will say. You can either take a Ghandi approach and settle it peacefully and keep calling her Derpy no matter what her name is...or you can just keep being 5-year-old girls and constantly whine about how one character got affected.
17:07 < Mariorulez14> Just getting my two-Bits into this.

17:30 < Azurite> Azurite Dawn idea: skip a few years into the future when everything's a little less boring, and fill in the missing space with memories and flashbacks.
17:30 < Mariorulez14> So in other words
17:31 < Mariorulez14> Make it like In the Lake of the Woods
17:31 < Mariorulez14> Only ponies
17:36 < Azurite> yeah
17:36 < Azurite> basically
17:36 < Azurite> also it's easier for me to write
17:36 < Mariorulez14> God that book was shit
17:37 < Mariorulez14> Don't make it shit like Lake of the Woods is
17:37 < Azurite> just have a chapter called "The Journals" and use it to get the reader up to speed before switching views (again) to first person
17:37 < Azurite> never really red it
17:37 < Mariorulez14> lol
17:37 < Mariorulez14> I should get some guidelines out on my Deadpool-Pinkie fic

18:04 < Azurite> but also have a sort of collage of all that we do
18:05 < Mariorulez14> Can there be Pinkie?
18:05 < Azurite> so there will be ponies, minecraft, ysflight, urban terror, a C:\ prompt, and some other random computer stuff in it
18:05 < Azurite> Mariorulez14 maybe
18:05 < Azurite> azurite, pinkie, and luna
18:05  * Azurite runs
18:05 < Compgeke> I kept doing barrel rolls on YSFlight
18:06 < Compgeke> until I crashed lol
18:06 < Mariorulez14> No Azurite
18:06 < Azurite> barrel rolls are fun
18:06 < Mariorulez14> Pinkie and Luna are fine
18:06 < Azurite> but Azurite owns the website...
18:06  * Compgeke loves being the owner
18:06 < Mariorulez14> 6:05 PM - Mariorulez14: Bs look shitty on Steam
18:06 < Mariorulez14> 6:05 PM - Mariorulez14: That or it's just me
18:06 < Mariorulez14> OH MAN
18:06 < Azurite> Compgeke wait, were you doing actual barrel rolls, or just spinning around in circles?
18:06 < Mariorulez14> THIS FANFIC
18:06 < Mariorulez14> I LOVE

18:07 < Azurite> hell
18:07 < Mariorulez14> And Celestia has rustled jimmies because Twilight disappeared
18:07 < Azurite> I need to redesign the whole site so it's not so me-oriented
18:07 < Compgeke> I just flip the joystick to the right
18:07 < Azurite> this is a COMMUNITY PLACE
18:07 < Mariorulez14> ^
18:07 < Azurite> Compgeke yeah, that's not a barrel roll
18:07 < Compgeke> looks like it
18:07 < Azurite> it's hard to tell the difference unless you've got a view of your trail
18:07 < Azurite> but a barrel roll has a lot of sideways motion involved
18:07 < Compgeke> hmm
18:08 < Azurite> so says my grandpa, who was in the air force and a massive plane nerd :P
18:08 < Compgeke> my joystick sucks
18:08 < Azurite> lol
18:08 < Azurite> I have a budget Logitech
18:08 < Azurite> it's pretty decent
18:08 < Compgeke> I would much rather use my Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro
18:08 < Azurite> throttle placement is retarded, though
18:08 < Compgeke> but Windows 7 lacks gameport support :(
18:08 < Azurite> cars > planes for me
18:08 < Azurite> I have a FF racing wheel

18:08 < Azurite> I love my wheel :D
18:09 < Azurite> Need for Speed: Undercover absolutely sucks...
18:09 < Compgeke> I'm not going to pay for one though
18:09 < Azurite> unless you use a wheel.
18:09 < Azurite> (also the loading screens in the middle of the game are annoying)
18:09 < Compgeke> lol
18:09 < Azurite> but that game is SO MUCH FUN with a wheel
18:09 < Azurite> because of ALL THE TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAYS
18:09 < Mariorulez14> Oh my friggin' gawd

18:51 < Tandyman100> binki: I didn't compile it, ` did.
18:51 <+binki> tandyman100: so... your point?
18:51 < Tandyman100> I dunno what he used
18:51 < Tandyman100> :P
18:51 < Tandyman100> or did
18:51 < Tandyman100> and I don't have my login credentials
18:51 < Tandyman100> ARGH
18:51 < Tandyman100> ` get in here
18:51 < Tandyman100> ` get in here
18:51 < Tandyman100> ` get in here
18:51 < Tandyman100> ` get in here
18:51 <+binki> use your knowledge to check how the compilation went retrospectively
18:51 <+binki> stop that
18:52 < Tandyman100> Check how the compilation went retrospectively?
18:52 < Tandyman100> Whaa?
18:52  * Tandyman100 uses his magic telepathic powers to figure out how ` compiled unreal
18:53 < Tandyman100> looks like we're gonna be waiting.
18:53 < Tandyman100> again
18:53 < Tandyman100> ._.
18:53 < Compgeke> lol
18:54 <+binki> lol, obviously if you can't even get to your unrealircd.conf you're far from being prepared to link :-p
18:54 <+binki> poke me when
18:54 < Tandyman100> binki: k. 
18:54 < Tandyman100> wait
18:54 < Tandyman100> I have a copy of my unrealircd.conf

18:58 < CommanderHurricane> oh well

19:00 < Tandyman100> I KNOW
19:00 < Tandyman100> and the certificate is there

19:02 < Mariorulez14> wat
19:02 < Mariorulez14> What's this about Propaganda?
19:02  * Mariorulez14 finds another L4D/MLP crossover :D
19:02 < CommanderHurricane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjyXqoEgFHs
19:02 < Mariorulez14> PLEASE BE GOOD
19:02 < CommanderHurricane> Mariorulez14 ^
19:03 < Mariorulez14> Name'
19:03 < Mariorulez14> *Name's Ellis is amazing
19:03 < Mariorulez14> Hopefully this one will live up to how good it sounds
19:04 <+binki> tandyman100: if you get access to the unrealircd.conf, try putting my IPv4 address in the `hostname' argument instead of "ohnopublishing.net" 
19:04  * Mariorulez14 has no clue why this is so catchy
19:05 <+binki> tandyman100: your unrealircd is compiled with SSL, so you're good there, but it's also compiled with IPv6 even though wtfpwnt.net doesn't have IPv6 AFAICT and thus it's probably trying to make an outbound IPv6 connection to my compy when it can't
19:06 <+binki> opening up port 6697 would allow my server to connect to yours and also clients to connect using SSL to your server, so you should do that eventually anyways
19:06 < CommanderHurricane> --- =-=-=-= Unreal3.2.9 =-=-=-=

19:06 < CommanderHurricane> i see
19:06 <+binki> :-|
19:07 <+binki> no time to spend on UnrealIRCd coding this semester at all :-/
19:07 < Tandyman100> lol
19:07 < Tandyman100> you helped code Unreal?!
19:07 <+binki> I helped poke at a few things for 3.2.8.1 -> 3.2.9
19:07 <+binki> only superficial things
19:07 <+binki> and also things which make packaging it on Gentoo work better
19:08 < Mariorulez14> Yeah, this fic's good
19:08 <+binki> O_o
19:08 <+binki> fic=fiction work?
19:09 < Tandyman100> yes
19:09 < Tandyman100> more specifically a fan fiction
19:09 < CommanderHurricane> <binki> I helped poke at a few things for 3.2.8.1 -> 3.2.9
19:09 < CommanderHurricane> <binki> only superficial things
19:10 < CommanderHurricane> and yet he got a spot in the /info credits
19:10 <+binki> yeah I know; it's odd
19:10 <+binki> well, it's because I'm the only "coder" who isn't syzop who is semi-active in unrealircd
19:11 < Tandyman100> ah
19:11 < Tandyman100> so that's why you're at the top of the list :P
19:11 < Tandyman100> You guys should implement a word-replacement function
19:12 < Tandyman100> like a really robust censor
19:12 <+binki> lol
19:12 < Tandyman100> that lets us create our own rules (like in phpbb) so I could, say, have "Waffles" changed into "the most delicious food ever"
19:12 <+binki> normaldotcom was thinking of circumcensoring
19:12 <+binki> I want to write that as a plugin someday
19:12 < Tandyman100> my forum has a bunch of censor rules like that to change swear words into more humorous worsd
19:12 < Tandyman100> words*
19:13 < Tandyman100> circumcensoring
19:13 < Tandyman100> that sounds Jewish
19:13  * Tandyman100 runs
19:13 <+binki> lol
19:13  * Tandyman100 hopes he didn't offend anybody
19:13  * Tandyman100 peeks out around a brick wall
19:13 <+binki> well, I think it's a common practice in western natal stuffage
19:13  * Tandyman100 tentatively steps out
