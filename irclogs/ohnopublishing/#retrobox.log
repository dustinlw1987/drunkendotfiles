19:02 < darman213> or were they made side-by-side?
19:02 < CommanderHurricane> there were three socket types during the Pentium 4 era
19:02 < CommanderHurricane> there was the early, large Pentium 4 chips
19:02 < CommanderHurricane> then there were the smaller, mPGA Pentium 4/Celeron chips
19:03 < CommanderHurricane> and the last socket type was LGA775, no pins on the CPU
19:03 < darman213> Well, this sucker has pins on it that I've got
19:03 < darman213> oh you're kidding me
19:03 < darman213> It's hardlocking on this Check File System on C
19:03 < darman213> -headesk
19:03 < CommanderHurricane> could be a bad power supply or bad RAM
19:03  * darman213 bangs head on desk
19:04 < darman213> This whole thing is junk...
19:04 < darman213> I think I'll have to Re-install XP tonight
19:04 < darman213> Great.
19:04 < CommanderHurricane> probably a good idea 
19:04 < CommanderHurricane> especially if it takes 10 minutes to boot
19:04 < darman213> I don't even know Where the heck I put that disc
19:05 < CommanderHurricane> http://goput.it/0hw.png
19:05 < darman213> screw it....
19:05 < darman213> -sigh-
19:05  * CommanderHurricane hands darman213 a box of wood screws and a drill
19:05 < CommanderHurricane> get to it
19:05 < CommanderHurricane> make nvidia proud
19:06 < darman213> well I'll read off what's on the processor...
19:06 < darman213> intel mc '01
19:07 < darman213> pentium (r) 4
19:07 < CommanderHurricane> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KL_Intel_Pentium_4_Wilamette.jpg
19:07 < CommanderHurricane> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Willamette.png
19:07 < darman213> 2.8 ghz / 512 /800 
19:07 < CommanderHurricane> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Intel_CPU_Pentium_4_640_Prescott_top.jpg
19:07 < CommanderHurricane> out of those three images, what does that P4 chip you've got look most like
19:08 < darman213> Willamette
19:09 < CommanderHurricane> second image?
19:10 < darman213> yeah, the second one
19:10 < darman213> sorry didn't notice those were both titled wilamette
19:12 < CommanderHurricane> then you've got an mPGA478 Pentium 4 chip
19:15  * darman213 is away: Lawl physics

17:19 < CommanderHurricane> sad thread <3
17:21  * Mariorulez14 reaches for tissues
17:21 < Mariorulez14> People are gonna be like "oh snaps you're cryin"

17:22 < Mariorulez14> NO
17:22 < Mariorulez14> I have completely lost all my sense of dignity at this point

17:24 < Mariorulez14> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1329802774462.png
17:24 < Mariorulez14> Aw man, I'm not looking forward to this day
17:25 < Mariorulez14> Not one bit
17:25 < Mariorulez14> Especially if something like this happens
17:26 < CommanderHurricane> "HI!"
17:26 < CommanderHurricane> Instantly the scene is blocked by something garishly pink and fluffy, you give a startled cry and tumble backwards, knocking the chair over and you hit the floor.
17:27 < Mariorulez14> THAT'S WHY
17:27 < Mariorulez14> THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
17:27 < Mariorulez14> If I have some crazy dream like this after seeing the last episode, I'm gonna lose it
17:30 < CommanderHurricane> i'm honestly not concerned about the end of the show
17:30 < CommanderHurricane> i know it'll happen one day and when it does, i can sit back, smile and truly say i had a wonderful time while it lasted
17:30 < Mariorulez14> ^
17:30 < Mariorulez14> ^ forever
17:31 < CommanderHurricane> i just hope it happens later than sooner
17:31  * ` is literally on the can POOSTAing
17:31 < Mariorulez14> inb4 they make several series
17:31 < CommanderHurricane> ` and we really needed to know that?
17:31 < Mariorulez14> Hasbro better make like anon and delivar
17:31 < CommanderHurricane> <CommanderHurricane> i know it'll happen one day and when it does, i can sit back, smile and truly say i had a wonderful time while it lasted
17:31 < CommanderHurricane> interestingly
17:31 < CommanderHurricane> i've had the same general thought about life
17:31 < Mariorulez14> I'm scared shitless of dying
17:32 < Mariorulez14> It's that feeling that you haven't done enough good to balance out the crap choices and you wish you had more time
17:32 < Mariorulez14> Like if I died tonight, I'd be wishing I'd at least finished my math homework than look at sad threads on /mlp/
17:33 < Mariorulez14> And I mean, what's dying even like?
17:33 < Mariorulez14> Are you conscious after you're in heaven or wherever you go, or is it like sleeping?
17:33 < Mariorulez14> And it's not like you can ask a dead person...
17:36 < Mariorulez14> Oh man
17:36 < Mariorulez14> Can't wait until Tandy and/or Darman get back in here and they see the sad thread (topic plx?)
17:37 < `> CommanderHurricane: sure, in the grand scheme of things.

19:51 < Darman213> I've never participated in lent before
19:51 < Mariorulez14|Maths> That just means we're gonna sort through our old junk and donate what we don't need to Goodwill/Salvation Army
19:51 < Darman213> So, you're giving up stuff/possessions you don't need
19:51 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I have so much clothing I can donate
19:52 < Mariorulez14|Maths> >mfw I just now have 20 minutes

20:11 < Compgeke> but I have no idea why that is selected
20:11 < Compgeke> tried the kX Audio drivers?

20:23 < Compgeke_> lol
20:23 < Compgeke_> I never have issues
20:23 < Compgeke_> and people always complain of the amount of ram it uses...
20:24 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Our internet is extremely unstable though
20:24 < Compgeke_> it uses like 13 MB ram
20:24 < Mariorulez14|Maths> >my steam's using 7MB
20:24 < Mariorulez14|Maths> That's a lot?
20:24 < Compgeke_> I guess
20:24 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Yeah, like I was saying
20:24 < Mariorulez14|Maths> My internet is so unstable that I can't get it remotely shut down

20:25 < Compgeke_> AT&T?
20:25 < Compgeke_> going to try running Minecraft on this :D
20:26 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Verizon, last I checked
20:26 < Mariorulez14|Maths> No, wait
20:26 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Mediacom
20:26 < Darman213> My steam uses anywhere from 13-22 mb :/ but I'm also on a 32 bit system
20:26 < Mariorulez14|Maths> "I am no longer Piccolo...I am...The Namek." -Piccolo
20:27 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I'm on a 32-bit system and it's settled into cruise control anywhere from 7-10MB
20:27 < Compgeke_> WOOT! Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
20:27 < Compgeke_> This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.
20:27 < Mariorulez14|Maths> lol 
20:27 < Darman213> Mariorulez14|Maths, I thought you were on win 7!?

20:29 < Darman213> I don't have enough data for this month Mario :p
20:29 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I've never gotten Hammer to not-freeze 
20:29 < Compgeke_> lol
20:30 < Darman213> Dad got on my case about how we've used 135 gb out of the allotted 150 gb
20:30 < Compgeke_> it uses 100% CPU on my C2D and takes forever to do anything
20:30 < Darman213> and god help us all
20:30 < Darman213> if he has to pay another 10$ for data.
20:30 < Darman213> for like another 25 gb
20:30 < Darman213> Idk
20:30 < Compgeke_> god, 135 gigs?
20:30 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I can't take Androids 16, 17 and 18 seriously when they're riding in a pink rape-van
20:30 < Compgeke_> what are you doing?
20:30 < Darman213> AT& fuckin- T
20:30 < Mariorulez14|Maths> lol
20:30 < Compgeke_> I have AT&T
20:31 < Darman213> watching youtube and streaming netflix
20:31 < Compgeke_> I run 2 MC servers and yet we never pass around 70 gigs
20:31 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Mediacom's worse, they don't even answer your calls
20:31 < Compgeke_> streaming Hulu 24/7 pretty much
20:31 < Mariorulez14|Maths> ^
20:31 < Mariorulez14|Maths> That's me when Dragon Ball Z
20:31 < Darman213> Well we've got 4 boys, and 2 parents
20:31 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Too bad I'm almost caught up with it...then it's One Piece time
20:31 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Maybe Fullmetal Alchemist 
20:31 < Darman213> said parents stream netflix for 3-4 hours every other night
20:32 < Darman213> Me and my bros accumulate to have about  3 hours of youtube daily
20:32 < Darman213> and that doesn't count Ponies
20:32 < `> all kinds of badass: http://www.psfk.com/2012/02/intel-flashmob-ultrabooks.html
20:32 < Mariorulez14|Maths> >3 hours of youtube a day
20:32 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I average maybe 5
20:32 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I win
20:33 < Darman213> Plus, school * 4 boys
20:33 < Darman213> mom and dad's flash games on facebook
20:33 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN 4 BOYS, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW MUCH FARTHER i CAN GO
20:33 < Darman213> lol caps lock.
20:33  * Mariorulez14|Maths crouches down and charges up his ki
20:33 < Darman213> I hold down shift
20:33 < Mariorulez14|Maths> WHAT IS 
20:33 < Mariorulez14|Maths> ..."SHIFT"
20:34 < Darman213> SHIFT ALLOWS ME TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS AND STILL TYPE FOR FUNKY CHARACTERS!@$()#$%*@)#%*!#$)%(!*#$%
20:34 < Mariorulez14|Maths> BUT CAPSLOCK MAKES IT EASIER TO TYPE THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
20:34 < Mariorulez14|Maths> INFINITELY TIMES MORESO
20:34 < Darman213> NOT REALLY
20:34 < Darman213> OH REALLY NOW?
20:34 < Mariorulez14|Maths> BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT KEEPING ONE FINGER ON THE SHIFT KEY
20:34 < Darman213> TRY ASKING A QUESTION IN THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!!!
20:34 < Mariorulez14|Maths> but even with cruise control, you still have to steer
20:35 < Darman213> indeed
20:35 < Mariorulez14|Maths> WHAT?
20:35 < Darman213> :3
20:35 < Darman213> you didn't use caps lock
20:35 < Mariorulez14|Maths> >Cell: Put on your rapeface
20:36 < Mariorulez14|Maths> You put on your rape face, levelling up your INTIMIDATION bar by 12. Piccolo, however, doesn't seem phazed in the slightest.
20:37 < Mariorulez14|Maths> A Homestuck-ish version of Dragon Ball Z would be hilarious
20:37 < Mariorulez14|Maths> They already have one for Woona, so why not
20:37 < Darman213> DBZ abridged*
20:37 < Darman213> it would make much more sense to do the abridged.
20:38 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Seriousl Darman213
20:38 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Look up Woonastuck
20:38 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Picture MLP in homestuck format
20:38 < Darman213> ._.
20:38 < Darman213> no thank
20:38 < Darman213> do nawt need
20:39 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Come on, it's the cutest, most adorable Tumblr blog ever
20:40  * Darman213 is done with Pre-calc for this week
20:40 < Darman213> Score
20:40 < Darman213> now to finish all 5 other classes
20:40 < Darman213> -_-
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> lol
20:40 < Darman213> I'm almost all caught up in physics
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I have to write some History paper
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> And it
20:40 < Darman213> then I can take a breather
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> is stupid
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> In an essay of approximately 500 words, explain how the imperialistic attitude of the United States fit the meaning of the proverb.
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Your paper must cover U.S. history from 1898 – 1920 and the material in our online textbook found in Unit 2: From the Age of Extremes to a World Power Section 5.
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Territory Gained at the Turn of the Century Directly after the Spanish American War included: 
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> 1.     Cuba (Quickly granted independence-with a catch)
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> 2.     Puerto Rico (granted US citizenship in 1917)
20:40 < Darman213> I need to do the Timed Writing for English still... and the Lit analysis...
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> 3.     Guam
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> 4.     Philippines (Granted independence in 1946)
20:40 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Of those four countries, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines essentially became part of the empire of the United States. 
20:41 < Darman213> That took way too long to scroll on my screen xD
20:41 < Darman213> haha
20:41 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Mr. Bachert didn't specify where in the text this is, and I can't find anything other than exactly what's there
20:41 < Mariorulez14|Maths> No elaboration
20:41 < Darman213> Apparently
20:41 < Darman213> It's in Section 5 of unit 2
20:41 < Darman213> :p
20:41 < Darman213> Read it all
20:41 < Mariorulez14|Maths> I did
20:41 < Compgeke_> what the fuck? the sound card has to do with poor Dell cooling? http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&l=en&s=gen&docid=DSN_07BDA138954A2EFCE0401E0A5517360B&isLegacy=true
20:42 < Mariorulez14|Maths> It gave us basic reasons as to why America wanted to expand and which territories it gained
20:42  * Darman213 facepalms
20:42 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Then it went into the Spanish-American War...well, the war part
20:42 < `> i really wish i had alot friends
20:42 < Mariorulez14|Maths> They didn't go into the politics part
20:42 < Darman213> Expansion
20:42 < `> so i could pull off a laptop flashmob
20:42 < `> }:A
20:42 < Darman213> Imperialistic
20:42 < Mariorulez14|Maths> Yeah

21:15 < Mariorulez14> *childish
21:15 < Compgeke> it's pissing me off

21:15 < Compgeke> he can't shut up and google something
21:15 < Mariorulez14> There's a manly sense in that somewhere

21:18 < Mariorulez14> Speaking of, gonna read My Little Dashie nao
21:18 -!- Mariorulez14 is now known as Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD
21:19 < Compgeke> great
21:19 < Compgeke> I'm in trouble now
21:19 < CommanderHurricane> ._.
21:19 < Compgeke> because I told my brother to shut the hell up, I'm sick of his crying
21:19 < CommanderHurricane> and how old is your brother
21:20 < Compgeke> 13
21:20 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> lol
21:20 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> And you see, Compgeke
21:20 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> That is why people think the internet has cancer
21:20 < CommanderHurricane> did his mind not grow past age 5 or something
21:21 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> Because of it allows 13-year-olds that cry over computer issues
21:21 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> Wow, I start up Google Docs and Chrome decides to go as slow as it can
21:21 < CommanderHurricane> happens to me all the time
21:22 < Compgeke> I'm waiting for her to disconnect her internet
21:22 < CommanderHurricane> Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/My-Little-Dashie
21:22 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> >guy feels down, goes for a walk to calm down
21:22 < CommanderHurricane> same story but on a different site
21:22 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> sounds like Harry Dredsen
21:22 < CommanderHurricane> and doesn't lag so bad as google docs
21:22 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> I will now refer to the main character as Harry Dresden getting Dashie
21:22 < CommanderHurricane> in fact, there's no lag
21:24  * Compgeke hopes his mom is happy that he is set back around 2 hours now that his brother can never me happy, and he just has to jump up and run when ever someone needs help
21:25 < CommanderHurricane> hmm, there's an idea.
21:25 < CommanderHurricane> compgeke, what browser does your brother use
21:26 < Compgeke> Chrome
21:26 < CommanderHurricane> and you said he uses Windows XP?
21:27 < Compgeke> yes
21:27 < Compgeke> 7 would run like crap on a gig of ram
21:27 < CommanderHurricane> alright, so my idea was to write a chrome extension
21:27 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> Harry Dresden has arrived at Point Alpha with the goods, roger-roger do you copy?
21:27 < CommanderHurricane> that takes whatever url he enters
21:27 < CommanderHurricane> and nullrouts it in /drivers/etc/hosts
21:27 < CommanderHurricane> nullroutes*
21:27 < CommanderHurricane> like
21:28 < CommanderHurricane> www.google.com     1.2.3.4
21:28 < CommanderHurricane> in the hosts file
21:28 < Compgeke> I want to direct everything to 127.0.0.1
21:29 < CommanderHurricane> that's possible too
21:29 < CommanderHurricane> so let's see how to write extensions for google chrome
21:30 < CommanderHurricane> <Compgeke> I want to direct everything to 127.0.0.1
21:30 < CommanderHurricane> what, are you going to install an httpd on his computer and have it swear at him? :P
21:30 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> "There are a lot of horrors on the internet, and she's not ready for it."
21:30 < CommanderHurricane> no kidding
21:31 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> He's scared she'll find 4chan
21:31 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> ._.
21:31 < CommanderHurricane> or worse
21:31 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> FURAFFINITY
21:31 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> *dun dun duunnnnnn*
21:31 < CommanderHurricane> Compgeke: so i'll look into writing a chrome extension to do that
21:32 < Mariorulez14|ReadingMLD> "So, the initial explosion brought upon many broken windows and set off car alarms in the next county. I quickly rounded her up and we rushed home before anyone could arrive at the park. I was lucky none of my windows were broken."

21:39 < CommanderHurricane> that's the part where he finds dashie in the woods after she ran off, no?
21:39 < Compgeke> Woot! Getting a 30" Apple display :D

09:03 <+binki> see how, even though the `eight' variable only takes up one byte, the following value sixteen is stored in the third instead of second byte of the struct

09:08 < Mariorulez14> Best band ever
09:10 < Tandyman100> that is amazing
09:10 < Mariorulez14> I know
09:10 < Mariorulez14> So I assume I have to re-sign up CommanderHurricane?
09:10 < CommanderHurricane> yes
09:10 <+binki> the reason I'm hitting struct alignment issues is that my one prof wanted me to represent datagrams with structs
09:10 < CommanderHurricane> and make 25 posts this time
09:11 < Mariorulez14> L
09:11 < Mariorulez14> *K
09:11 <+binki> but apparently structs' layouts depend on the arch you're on
09:11 <+binki> so
09:11 <+binki> I guess instead I'll have to think of a `packing / unpacking' API for my datagrams
09:11 <+binki> so that I can say `insert a "session identifier" into the packet' or `extract a "session identifier" from the packtet'
09:12 < Tandyman100> heh
09:12 <+binki> instead of writing *(sruploader_session_t *)(sizeof(uint16_t) + (void *)packet) = htons(session_id);
09:13 <+binki> and having to remember the exact layout of every packet and stuff
09:13 <+binki> because it can get confusing to write at that point

11:17 < CommanderHurricane> Ford said... 
11:17 < CommanderHurricane>  So I examined number one, which is near-or-above awesome, and noticed a few things I didn't notice at first:
11:17 < CommanderHurricane> Although only two of the Mane 6 are present, all six of them are represented by symbolic items nevertheless. Twilight is represented by the book on which she happily rests, and Applejack by the apple on her book. There dangles a cyan balloon to honor Pinkie, and a feather of the same color may have once been a part of Rainbow's plumage. A pink butterfly rests on Spike's saddlebags to pay tribute to Fluttershy, and dangling from 
11:17 < CommanderHurricane> the saddlebags is a white scarf with Rarity's cutie mark on it.
11:17 < CommanderHurricane> I also note that there seems to be some degree of interaction between objects which hints at the relationships each of the Mane Six share. The apple rests on the book, perhaps as a reference to the strong friendship Applejack shared with Twilight. The butterfly rests on the saddlebag carrying the scarf, and sure enough, Fluttershy and Rarity are likely best friends. Although the feather and balloon are not within a close proximi
11:17 < CommanderHurricane> ty of each other, they both fly free in the sky, perhaps to recall the carefree spirits they represented. Moreover, they also share a color, much as Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie enjoyed sharing interests.
11:17 < CommanderHurricane> I must say I enjoy this image greatly! God bless you, Harwick.

11:28 < Tandyman100> sort of
11:28 < Mariorulez14> So I could just split my C: drive somehow?
11:29 < Mariorulez14> How does that even work
11:29 < CommanderHurricane> you could
11:29 < CommanderHurricane> with software
11:29 < Tandyman100> 1. Download a Knoppix disk
11:30 < Tandyman100> 2. Boot said Knoppix disk
11:30 < CommanderHurricane> GParted*
11:30 < Tandyman100> 3. Open GParted
11:30 < Tandyman100> dedicated gparted disk can't do other neat stuff if you need it to
11:30 < Tandyman100> knoppix disk is more useful in the log run
11:30 < CommanderHurricane> why are you running on logs
11:30 < Tandyman100> 4. shrink your current partition
11:30 < Tandyman100> 5. create new ntfs partition
11:30 < Tandyman100> 6. apply changes
11:30 < Tandyman100> 7. hope that you backed up

13:02 < Blazehoof> I read it Jake
13:03 < Blazehoof> the Cherelee's garden. It is worse than cupcakes.
13:05 < Blazehoof> But It was not very well written with what I read from your post. Each death was quickly written off.
13:07 <~RainbowDash> Are you as bored as I am right now?
13:07 < Blazehoof> maybe
13:07 < Blazehoof> how bored are you?
13:08 <~RainbowDash> Pretty bored. No weather jobs today, no books to read, not even a new or old trick to practice...
13:09 < Blazehoof> Oh I know a trick
13:09 -!- Mariorulez14|Choir is now known as Mariorulez14
13:09 < Mariorulez14> Alright, brony friends were talking about fanmusic
13:09 <~RainbowDash> Really? I'd love to hear it
13:09 < Blazehoof> ok if you take a pencil.
13:09 < Mariorulez14> <Blazehoof> the Cherelee's garden. It is worse than cupcakes.
13:09 < Mariorulez14> Yes it was
13:10 < Mariorulez14> And I personally thought it was really well-written 
13:10 < Mariorulez14> Each death was quickly written off.
13:10  * CommanderHurricane np: Billyboy (MIDI)
13:10 < Mariorulez14> No
13:10 < Mariorulez14> No they weren't
13:10 < Mariorulez14> The deaths in Rainbow Factory were faster imo
13:10 < Mariorulez14> At least the suffering if memory serves
13:11 < Mariorulez14> Anyway, fanmusic
13:11 < Blazehoof> Have you watched a plathrough of any silent hill games Mario
13:11 < Mariorulez14> We were joking about MLP parodies of songs and I joked that I was going to write a version of Rainbow Connection about Pinkie Pie
13:11 < Mariorulez14> They said I should
13:11 < CommanderHurricane> and now he has to
13:11 < Mariorulez14> And I thought up the first part on the way back
13:11 < CommanderHurricane> yep
13:13 <~RainbowDash> Blazehoof: You going to tell me that trick of yours?
13:13 < Blazehoof> right
13:13 < Mariorulez14> "Why aren't there any
13:13 < Mariorulez14> songs about Pinkie
13:13 < Mariorulez14> and how she can make us smile.
13:13 < Mariorulez14> I'll be on YouTube, searching new fanmusic
13:13 < Mariorulez14> or ones I haven't heard in a while.
13:13 < Mariorulez14> I'll find some songs about Rainbow and Twilight
13:13 < Mariorulez14> so many it's hard to believe...
13:13 < Blazehoof> If you wiggle a pencil up and down just right it starts to look like rubber.
13:13 < Mariorulez14> ...someday I'll find it,
13:13 < Mariorulez14> a song about Pinkie,
13:13 < Mariorulez14> the cupcakes, the laughter,
13:13 < Mariorulez14> and me."
13:14 < Mariorulez14> The main conversation was about the lack of Pinkie music, initially
13:14 <~RainbowDash> Eh. Did that plenty of times back in school.
13:14 < Blazehoof> yeah
13:14 < Mariorulez14> All I need is a full lyrics list and a background music track for Rainbow Connection and I'll get to singing this
13:15 < CommanderHurricane> i'm going to install Windows 2000
13:16 < Mariorulez14> So who can help me out with finding an instrumental track for Rainbow Connection
13:16 < CommanderHurricane> youtube -> rainbow connection instrumental
13:17 < Mariorulez14> What do you suggest doing for a brilliant-quality rip of it

13:18 < Tandyman100> <Blazehoof> If you wiggle a pencil up and down just right it starts to look like rubber.
13:18 < Tandyman100> My sides
13:18 < Tandyman100> oh god
13:18 < Mariorulez14> Well yeah, Audacity
13:18 < Tandyman100> that was just so random I started giggling like crazy
13:18 < Mariorulez14> I mean for ripping the instumental
13:18 < CommanderHurricane> <CommanderHurricane> set to highest quality -> record from stereo mix
13:19 < CommanderHurricane> from youtube
13:19 < Tandyman100> <Mariorulez14> The deaths in Rainbow Factory were faster imo
13:19 < Tandyman100> this
13:19 < Tandyman100> it was just maybe 15 seconds of pain. Ribs broken, then tossed in a grinder. That's it.
13:19 < Mariorulez14> Yeah, Cheerilee's Garden was just like
13:19 < Mariorulez14> Damn
13:19 < Tandyman100> honestly
13:19 < Tandyman100> the most brutal was Scootaloos
13:19 < Mariorulez14> I feel terrible for Sweetie Belle
13:19 < Tandyman100> and it happened WAY too soon
13:20 < Tandyman100> it was like THREE PONIES GONE IN AN INSANE GORY MESS
13:20 < Mariorulez14> Sweetie Belle was the worst for me, tbh
13:20 < CommanderHurricane> WHERE IS MY WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL CD
13:20 < Tandyman100> and then just some cheap tricks to get rid of the rest.
13:20 < Tandyman100> lol CommanderHurricane
13:20 < Mariorulez14> And I laughed at Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
13:20 < Tandyman100> heh
13:20 < Mariorulez14> Because I hate them with the burning intensity of 1,000,000 suns
13:21 < Tandyman100> lol
13:21 < Mariorulez14> Also, did you notice that Silver Spoon and the needle was a lot like the Needle scene from Dead Space 2?
13:21 < Mariorulez14> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KCjVeYNS3c
13:21 < Tandyman100> yeah
13:21 < Tandyman100> that's the first thing that came to mind
13:21  * CommanderHurricane np: MandoPony - We Make A Perfect Team (160kbps)
13:21 < Mariorulez14> That's part of what made it hilarious
13:21 < Tandyman100> "Oh, she bucked up the needle."
13:21 < Mariorulez14> I actaully played this over the scene
13:22 < Mariorulez14> And it was that much funnier
13:22 < Tandyman100> YAKETY SAX
13:22 < CommanderHurricane> QUICK, TO THE BENNY HILLIFIER
13:22 < Mariorulez14> That came to mind with Sweetie Bell and the rats

13:23 < Mariorulez14> SOMEONE, QUICK
13:23 < Mariorulez14> BRING FREUD BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HELP THIS CHILD
13:24 < Blazehoof> The only reason I was not completely digusted by Cherillees Garden is I have seen, read, and heard worse.
13:25 < Mariorulez14> That's the worst I've read and it wasn't as bad as /mlp/ were saying
13:25 < CommanderHurricane> <Mariorulez14> BRING FREUD BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HELP THIS CHILD
13:25 < Blazehoof> <Mariorulez14> BRING FREUD BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HELP THIS CHILD << Who is Freud?

14:08 < CommanderHurricane> Tandyman100 that has to be a shop
14:08 < CommanderHurricane> unless north carolina lets you put slashes in your license plate
14:08 < Mariorulez14> All I'm getting are crappy cover versions and the actual vocal version
14:09 < Mariorulez14> I want the ACTUAL version
14:09 < Mariorulez14> That's INSTRUMENTAL
14:09 < Tandyman100> is this the Muppets song?

14:18 < Mariorulez14> Oh look, Shadowfan's accusing bronies of having an unhealthy obsession
14:19 < Mariorulez14> The irony in that is that he does nothing but play video games in his spare time
14:19 < Mariorulez14> Ryan Crissler #2: Bronies = obsessions. End of discussion.
14:19 < Mariorulez14> Ryan Crissler #2: Nothing more needs to be said
14:19 < CommanderHurricane> hypocrite

14:30 < Blazehoof> I just read yours truely
14:31 < Tandyman100> Ryan Crissler S51980430025 S51980430025 #2: I don't JUST play vidoe games. I read books too. Don't be a prejudice when you do the same thing.

14:31 < Tandyman100> Me to Ryan Crissler S51980430025 S51980430025 #2: haw, I've read more books than you can comprehend. I read 4k pages in about two weeks last month.
14:31 < Tandyman100> Ryan Crissler S51980430025 S51980430025 #2: That doesn't matter. Just pay attention.
14:37 < Mariorulez14> HAH
14:37 < Mariorulez14> You see why?
14:38 < Mariorulez14> You see why I can't stand him half the time?
14:38 < Mariorulez14> And to be honest, he only reads what he has to for school. His Sonic comics don't count for crap.
14:38 < Mariorulez14> Manga, either
14:44 < Mariorulez14> Woo, lyrics for Pinkie Connection are done
14:46 < Mariorulez14> So is there any alternative for Audacity recording? Will other things like a live class interfere with the sound?
14:46 < Tandyman100> >manga
14:46 < Tandyman100> ugh
14:46 < Mariorulez14> CommanderHurricane?
14:46 < CommanderHurricane> Mariorulez14?
14:46 < Mariorulez14> So is there any alternative for Audacity recording? Will other things like a live class interfere with the sound?
14:46 < Tandyman100> Tandyman100?
14:47 < CommanderHurricane> yes, a live class will interfere
14:47 < Mariorulez14> Myaah
14:47 < CommanderHurricane> Stereo Mix records everything that comes out of your speakers
14:47 < Mariorulez14> So are there any programs other than Audacity that can give me a god-tier recording?
14:49 < CommanderHurricane> audacity is free, what's wrong with it
14:49 < Mariorulez14> Well I want do rip it while I'm in class
14:49 < Mariorulez14> *to
14:50 < CommanderHurricane> well you can use a youtube download but it'll be slightly lower quality
14:50 < CommanderHurricane> since compression and conversion and all that fun stuff
14:51  * Tandyman100 renders a new youtube video
14:54 < Mariorulez14> >moonshine isn't legal to make, even with a liscence
14:55 < Mariorulez14> But what about all those people that self-brew their own alcohol?

15:01 < CommanderHurricane> http://goput.it/5nb.png
15:01 < Mariorulez14> Well, it turns into a shitty MIDI at the end
15:02 < Mariorulez14> Can't use that one
15:04 < Tandyman100> lolwut CommanderHurricane
15:05 < Mariorulez14> Guys 
15:05 < Mariorulez14> Go to #PinkieConnection
15:05 < Mariorulez14> Putting the draft of my lyrics there
15:10 < Mariorulez14> So yeah, I need a good instrumental version since the one I chose has crap-tacular MIDI drumsounds added to the banjo at the end
15:11 < Mariorulez14> :|
15:14 < Mariorulez14> Any way I could hax the vocal track out of a vocal version?
15:14 < CommanderHurricane> you could but it's time-consuming from what i hear
15:15 < Mariorulez14> Eeeh
15:15 < Mariorulez14> I'm /r/ing some help from you guys
15:16 < Tandyman100> lol
15:16 < Mariorulez14> I need a good version that at least sounds close
15:16 < Mariorulez14> Not this one, though

15:23 < Tandyman100> but still decent
15:23 < Mariorulez14> Eh
15:23 < Mariorulez14> It's from the movie
15:23 < Mariorulez14> Have you HEARD the movie-quality?
15:26 < Mariorulez14> OK, so I enable Stereo Mix and just hit Record on Audacity?
15:26 < Tandyman100> I don't care if you're black, white, straight, bisexual, gay , lesbian, short, tall, fat, skinny, rich or poor. If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. Simple as that." -eminem

15:32 < CommanderHurricane> Tandyman100: not subscribed to renard
15:32 < Mariorulez14> So I can record another track without recording over the initial music, right?
15:32 < Mariorulez14> I forgot everything about Audacity
15:33 < Blazehoof> Shadowvox is a furry?....... I never would have guessed.
15:33 < CommanderHurricane> yes
15:33 < CommanderHurricane> be sure to mute the original track though

16:03  * Mariorulez14 wishes his dad wasn't home so I could do 20% better
16:03 < Mariorulez14> Seriously, why is he home right now
16:03 < Mariorulez14> He said he'd be working until like 10
16:04 < `> Mariorulez14: so what exactly's the problem?
16:04 < Mariorulez14> Singing a song I wrote words for, need to sing louder
16:04 < Mariorulez14> But my dad's home/asleep
16:05 < Mariorulez14> There's nowhere I can go in the house that he can't hear me in
16:08 <+binki> `: thought you said wtfpunt.net....
16:09 < `> binki: er, must have been jaek's misspelling :|
16:09 < `> binki: also CNAME isn't ideal in this type of config since the VM has a static IP.
16:10 < `> binki: so thats why we needed an A record :P
16:10 <+binki> no sense making
16:11 < `> wtfpwnt.net has address 10.178.226.117
16:11 < `> that's weird
16:11 < `> if i host it from inside the VM, it gives the private IP
16:11 <+binki> ah, that's my misreading
16:11 < `> lol, but wtfpwnt.net is 108.166.7.185, and that's the VM he's using
16:12 < `> make sure it's 108.166.7.185. :D
16:12 <+binki> fixed CNAME
16:12 < `> er, what about A record?
16:12 <+binki> why? :-p
16:12 < Mariorulez14> What format should I do this in, ID3v1 or ID3v2?
16:13 < `> binki: static IP. will not change.
16:13 <+binki> v2 unless if you explicitly want to support ancient things
16:13 < `> binki: all the CNAME does is query *my* DNS server for the IP
16:13 <+binki> `: so?
16:13 <+binki> but the server serving the CNAME caches that for you
16:13 < `> we can take out the extra hop, that's all.
16:14 <+binki> or not
16:14 <+binki> more semantic :-)
16:14 < Mariorulez14> They'll never notice me in the stream of technobabble...now's my chance!
16:15 < `> in other words, you're just too lazy to actually delete the CNAME and create the A record - more simpler to just edit the CNAME record, isn't it?
16:15 <+binki> it's more informative than just having a random IP in the file
16:15 < Mariorulez14> "I'm such a lovely dancing boy!" -Mr. 2, One Piece
16:16 < `> binki: so you're literally hand-editing the DNS zone files?
16:16 <+binki> of course :-p
16:16 < `> binki: hardcore. i'm not even THAT good yet.
16:17 < `> but ok, suit yourself - as long as it works/points to the right place
16:17 <+binki> yup, it is
