22:14 -!- Irssi: Starting query in ohnopublishing with Tandy|T43p
22:14 <`> cocks.
22:14 <Tandy|T43p> <censored>?
22:15 <`> lol put ` between the letters
22:15 <`> damn ircd censored you
22:15 <Tandy|T43p> lolwjut
22:15 <Tandy|T43p> lolwut*
22:15 <Tandy|T43p> uhm
22:15 <Tandy|T43p> so
22:15 <Tandy|T43p> username and pass pl0x
22:15 <`> server wtfpwnt.net
22:15 <Tandy|T43p> lol
22:15 <`> retrobox
22:15 <`> 52jlh762l45kj67h2l
22:16 <`> you'll have a freshly compiled Unreal for you
22:16 <Tandy|T43p> you'll have to tell me again Thursday when I'm back in Mansas
22:16 <`> in ~/Unreal3.2
22:16 <Tandy|T43p> lol
22:16 <Tandy|T43p> ok
22:16 <Tandy|T43p> I'll winscp my preconfigured <censored> into it
22:16 <Tandy|T43p> and it'll be all linked up to binki's ircd :D
22:16 <`> wtf are you using that the ircd censors you?
22:17 <`> also
22:17 <`> once binki points the irc.retro-box.net A record to that server
22:17 <`> you'll be all set.
22:18 <Tandy|T43p> ok
22:18 <Tandy|T43p> are irc and minecraft ports fowarded to it?
22:18 <Tandy|T43p> or is it set outside of your firewall completely?
22:19 <`> it should have 25525 open
22:19 <`> as well as 6667-7000
22:21 <Tandy|T43p> ok
22:21 <`> because afaik, minecraft just needs 25525 tcp/udp
22:21 <Tandy|T43p> yup
22:24 <`> also
22:24 <`> it'll have screen and irssi
22:24 <`> so just do
22:24 <`> screen -S irssi
22:24 <`> and then irssi
22:25 <`> then bam, you have a "permanent" irssi session
22:25 <`> CTRL a d to detach
22:25 <`> screen -ls
22:25 <`> screen -dr $PID (the number before .irssi shown in screen -ls)
22:26 <`> got it?
22:29 <Tandy|T43p> yeah
22:29 <Tandy|T43p> screen never works right via putty
22:29 <Tandy|T43p> ._.
22:29 <Tandy|T43p> I dunno why
22:29 <Tandy|T43p> but it makes putty crash when I try to de/re-attach the screen
22:31 <`> >putty
22:31 <`> use something better
22:31 <`> like oh, say, linux?
22:33 <Tandy|T43p> heh
22:33 <Tandy|T43p> I have a debian lappie...
22:33  * Tandy|T43p looks at the E5400
22:34 <`> that's better.
22:34 <`> use it.
22:34 <`> on the debian lappy
22:34 <`> do
22:34 <`> ssh-keygen
22:35 <`> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa retrobox@wtfpwnt.net
22:35 <`> then bam, you'll be able to login DIRECTLY
22:35 <`> without ever giving a password
22:35 <`> by doing ssh retrobox@wtfpwnt.net
22:37 <Tandy|T43p> ooh
22:38 <`> yup.
22:38  * ` pets ssh-copy-id
