20:02 < Compgeke> I found a reactOS disk lol
20:02 < `> pwd incorrect
20:02 < `> you created a sha1, right?
20:02 < `> you didn't paste it in plaintet?
20:02 < `> *plaintext
20:02 < neko|TwiSpark> yeah, it's sha1
20:02 < `> hmm
20:02 < `> nope
20:04 < Compgeke> ok, I have 5 XP disks, a Server 2003 disk and a ReactOS disk...
20:04 < Compgeke> I must be out of blank CDs :/
20:05 < `> flashstick it
20:05 < `> just dd it to the nearest available flash drive
20:05 < `> and lolinstall
20:07 < Compgeke> I don't have a flash drive xD
20:07 < Compgeke> it got stolen
20:08 < `> who steals flash drives.
20:08 < `> ._____.
20:08 < Compgeke> someone at the library
20:08 < neko|TwiSpark> i would have guessed tards at school
20:09 < Compgeke> hmm
20:10 < `> that sucks.
20:10 < neko|TwiSpark> inb4 it was only a 1-2GB flash drive
20:10 < `> inb4 64G stick
20:10 < Compgeke> it was a 4 gig
20:11 < Compgeke> I don't want a 64 gig or anything
20:11 < Compgeke> if I loose it I would kill myself
20:11 < neko|TwiSpark> if i want a 64GB flash device, i want it to be an SSD }:A
20:11 < Compgeke> same
20:11 < `> yup
20:11 < `> what i really want is an EyeFi Pro card
20:12 < neko|TwiSpark> i still find it interesting there's a USB port inside the eSATA port on this laptop
20:12 < `> http://www.eye.fi/products/prox2
20:12 < Compgeke> I've seen those
20:12 < Compgeke> the USB/esata combo
20:12 < `> fuckers can upload pics straight from the camera
20:12 < `> so i would never have to take it out
20:12 < `> ever.
20:13 < Compgeke> I want a Rebel
20:13 < Compgeke> Canon Rebel
20:13 < `> Compgeke: you'll hate me
20:13 < Compgeke> if I take out the card, who cares?
20:13  * ` has one.
20:13  * Compgeke has a rebel, but it's a film one with a crappy 80-200mm lens
20:13 < Compgeke> with the slowest autofocus EVER
20:13 < `> the EOS Digital Rebel XSi
20:14 < Compgeke> I know someone with a Mark 5D, he paid close to 7 grand D:
20:14 < `> i love its continuous shooting
20:14 < `> but alas, my lens aren't IS
20:14 < `> i need to buy IS lens
20:14 < Compgeke> I love taking pictures and never developing film
20:14 < `> lol
20:14 < Compgeke> I have like 5 rolls of film
20:14 < Compgeke> and it's like $12 per roll
20:14 < Compgeke> to develop
20:14 < `> throw them at a cheap photo processor
20:14 < `> like walmart
20:15 < `> they're what, $6 a roll
20:15 < `> iirc
20:15 < Compgeke> that's where it's $12
20:15 < `> .__________.
20:15 < `> they doubled it, then
20:15 < Compgeke> everything is expensive here
20:15 < Compgeke> even rent...$1400 a month is a lot
20:15 < `> yup
20:15 < `> no kidding.
20:16 < Compgeke> and that is considered cheap here
20:16 < `> my old 3 bedroom house was luckily 900/mo
20:16 < Compgeke> we have a 2 bed/1 bath
20:16 < `> but the landlady pretty much fucked me over by letting the house get foreclosed
20:16 < neko|TwiSpark> x.x
20:16 < `> and out of the blue, the bank just came up and gave me a notice to GTFO
20:16 < Compgeke> we're evicted xD
20:16 < `> i refused, as 14 days notice wasn't enough
20:16 < `> they waffled
20:16 < `> so i told them, bitches, i dont have the money to move
20:17 < Compgeke> we have until April 1st
20:17 < `> so they gave me $2500
20:17 < `> }:A
20:17 < neko|TwiSpark> >house evicted
20:17 < Compgeke> because "Owner wats to repair property"
20:17 < `> so naturally, i got the fuck out
20:17 < neko|TwiSpark> >has to move on April 1st
20:17 < Compgeke> about time...we've been complaining for 3 years now
20:17 < `> Compgeke: i hope the landlord will compensate you for that.
20:18  * neko|TwiSpark brbs
20:20 < `> neko|TwiSpark: now that i have +N, i dont need a tilde
20:20 < `> YAY DRIVE BY /KILLS AND /KICKS
20:20 < `> nonotrly
20:20 < Compgeke> "The installer could not detect any disks suitable for installation (IDE/SCSI)"
20:21 < Compgeke> NOOO!!!!!!1
20:21 < `> what
20:21 < `> pfsense doesnt do scuzzy?
20:21 < Compgeke> it doesn't like the Dell Perc 3/di
20:21 < Compgeke> it doesn't like RAID
20:21 < Compgeke> lets go change it to SCSI :/
20:21 < Compgeke> the 1850 and 2650 have RAID
20:21 < `> still
20:21 < `> it should present to the system as an SCSI disk
20:21 < `> 4.4.1. What kind of hard drives does FreeBSD support?
20:21 < `> FreeBSD supports EIDE, SATA, SCSI, and SAS drives (with a compatible controller; see the next section), and all drives using the original “Western Digital” interface (MFM, RLL, ESDI, and of course IDE). A few ESDI controllers that use proprietary interfaces may not work: stick to WD1002/3/6/7 interfaces and clones.
20:21 < `> 4.4.2. Which SCSI or SAS controllers are supported?
20:22 < `> See the complete list in the Hardware Notes for FreeBSD 7.1 or 6.4.
20:22 < `> so basically, check out the notes
20:22 < `> and see if there's any special cases for the PERCs
20:23 < `> 3/di, right?
20:24 < `> Controllers supported by the aac(4) driver include:
20:24 < `> [snip]
20:24 < `> Dell CERC SATA RAID 2
20:24 < `> Dell PERC 2/Si
20:24 < `> Dell PERC 2/QC
20:24 < `> Dell PERC 3/Si
20:24 < `> Dell PERC 3/Di
20:24 < `> Dell PERC 320/DC
20:24 < `> [snip]
20:24 < `> so it should be completely supported

20:34 < Compgeke> there, works on SCSI mode
20:34 < Compgeke> installing now
20:35 < Compgeke> although it still is complaining of bad ram...I'll look into that later as it works for now
20:37 < `> Compgeke: i wonder if it's a bad socket?
20:37 < `> yank the RAM from that particular socket
20:37 < `> then put it elsewhere and leave it empty
20:37 < `> rerun
20:40 < `> Compgeke: iirc, my PERC4/di worked for pfsense 2.x?
20:40 < `> Compgeke: so i'm sorta surprised the 3/di didn't work.
20:42 < Compgeke> :/
20:42 < Compgeke> it wants a WAN interface 
20:42 < `> do it
20:43 < `> it does autodetect
20:43 < Compgeke> but I don't know which adapters are which stuff
20:43 < `> like i said
20:43 < `> autodetect
20:43 < Compgeke> and it won't autodetect a cross over cable and my laptop
20:43 < `> just plug it into a switch
20:43 < `> it only needs to see a linkup
20:43 < Compgeke> if I had a 25' cable I would xD
20:43 < `> try NOT a crossover
20:43 < `> just a regular cable
20:44 < Compgeke> got my brother's network cable
20:44 < Compgeke> his computer is messed up anyways
20:44 < `> wololo, go ahead.
20:46 -!- Mariorulez14 [Mariorulez@o_o-51655395.client.mchsi.com] has joined #retrobox
20:46 < Compgeke> still doesn't want to work
20:46 < Compgeke> it's detecting state changes
20:46 < Compgeke> "xl0 state changed to "up"
20:46 < `> you have to hit a
20:46 < `> enter
20:46 < Compgeke> I did
20:46 < `> wait
20:47 < `> unplug everything (ethernets)
20:47 < `> then a, enter
20:47 < Compgeke> only one cable detected
20:47 < Compgeke> ok
20:47 < `> plug in the iface you want
20:47 < `> then enter
20:47 -!- Mariorulez14 [Mariorulez@o_o-51655395.client.mchsi.com] has quit [Ping timeout]
20:47 < `> it should properly associate WAN to that iface
20:47 < `> it's an exact procedure
20:47 < Compgeke> ok
20:47 < `> i had trouble at first.
20:47 < `> as you did
20:47 < `> so the process is
20:48 < `> when it says "PRESS A TO AUTODETECT"
20:48 < `> unplug all eth cables
20:48 < `> then a, etner
20:48 < `> plug in the iface you want for the particular iface (WAN, LAN, OPT1)
20:48 < `> enter
20:48 < `> it should then ask you for LAN
20:48 < Compgeke> got iy
20:49 < `> it's weird at first, but yeah
20:49 < `> :D
20:49 < Compgeke> it wants LAN now...how do I know which of the Broadcom NetXtreme cards are which!?
20:49 < `> LAN doesn't matter
20:49 < Compgeke> ok
20:49 < `> the switch itself does the routing
20:49 < `> the LAN is just the "uplink to the LAN"
20:49 < `> so unless your internets exceed 100mbit, you wont have a problem.
20:50 < Compgeke> there, now it's working
20:50 < `> }:A
20:50 < `> now
20:50 < Compgeke> configuring stuff
20:50 < `> plug your computer into the LAN iface
20:50 < `> you should then be able to get an IP from it
20:50 < `> and access the webConfigurator
20:50 < Compgeke> I never selected a LAN one, so any port?
20:50 < `> err
20:50 < `> it requires LAN
20:50 < Compgeke> or reinstall, it takes 5 minutes
20:50 < `> ._______.
20:51 < `> as in
20:51 < Compgeke> it went through without me selecting a LAN xD
20:51 < `> wat.
20:51  * ` blinks
20:51 < `> whatever, try reinstall
20:51 < Compgeke> it's beeping at me D:
20:51 < `> and pay careful attention
20:52 < CommanderHurricane> computers are at my window making irritating noise
20:53 < `> lolol
20:53 < Compgeke> there, it let me reassign
20:53 < Compgeke> sis0 is WAN, xl0 is LAN
20:54 < Compgeke> so cheap Belkin card is WAN
20:54 < Compgeke> 3Com is LAN
20:54 < Compgeke> and Broadcom Gigabit's aren't assigned right now
20:54 < `> goody.
20:54 < `> then you should be able to "drop" that in the place of your existing router
20:54 < `> then bam, overpowered router
20:54 < `> xD

21:33 < `> just get an IP from it
21:33 < `> an DHCP IP
21:33 < `> then look at the IP
21:34 < `> the router's IP will be x.x.x.1
21:34 < Compgeke> the laptop isn't getting DHCP :/
21:34 < `> hmm
21:34 < `> where is it now?
21:34 < `> and can you see the console?

21:35 < Mariorulez14> So Tandy|7540

21:36 < Tandy|7540> work-safe and lulzy
21:36 < `> Compgeke: ??
21:36 < Tandy|7540> Mariorulez14: first I have to find a way to get FRIGGIN TECHNIC PACK INSTALLED.
21:36 < Mariorulez14> >friendship is marinade
21:36 < Mariorulez14> Oh God forever lols
21:36 < Tandy|7540> then I can put the server up and start building the map
21:36 < Compgeke> there, enabled DHCP through the console
21:36 < Mariorulez14> Did you get Mo' Creatures in with no problems?
21:36 < Compgeke> on LAN
21:37 < `> Compgeke: what the fuck
21:37 < Mariorulez14> Mo' Creatures was being terrible for me
21:37 < `> Compgeke: DHCP wasn't enabled by default?

21:37 < `> wtf are you using, 2.0.1-release?
21:37 < Mariorulez14> Tandy|7540:Try YouTube, there's a European 12-year-old with a video out there somewhere

21:40 < `> your main router and the pfsense router is conflicting
21:40 < Tandy|7540> "Hey, I hear you like pie. How about you have some Pinkie Pie? I know you'll enjoy it..."
21:41 < `> both have subnets of 192.168.1.x
21:41 < Compgeke> no, laptop wireless is disabled
21:41 < `> Compgeke: you dont get it
21:41 < CommanderHurricane> Tandy|7540: ._.
21:41 < `> Compgeke: the WAN is pulling in the 192.168.1.11 IP
21:41 < `> which means it's in that subnet
21:41 < Compgeke> meh, I really can't disable the DD-WRT yet
21:41 < `> and then it's trying to DHCP out the IPs which conflict
21:41 < Compgeke> I can go change the LAN IP
21:41 < Compgeke> brb

23:08 < `> ok got it
23:08 < `> normally, the default port is 222
23:08 < `> so
23:08 < `> telnet 10.0.0.1 222
23:08 < `> i prefer ssh, however.

09:06 < CH|mIRC> “These celebrities… they are the new form of nobility, no?”  Tears sprung to Luna’s lashes as she pushed the stack of magazines towards Celestia and gestured to the front cover of one. Cosmarepolitan. Celestia gently pressed the inside of her cheek with her tongue. She had read this magazine occasionally before for… for the makeup section. Yes, just for the makeup section. 
09:06 < CH|mIRC> This particular issue was graced with the slim form of Canterlot’s most popular fashion model, Fleur De Lis. Even Celestia had to admit, the mare was the very definition of beautiful. Apparently, she was also very flexible if the articles in the se-MAKEUP. Yes. If the articles in the makeup section were anything to go by. 
09:06 < CH|mIRC> Oh how she hoped she wasn’t blushing.

09:11 < CH|mIRC> Celestia gave a tired sigh and looked towards the ceiling. She seemed to be doing that a lot today. In fact, the whole wishing for a miracle thing was beginning to get pretty redundant. “It’s actually less of a plan and more of a tradition by now. There’s a whole slew of policies and protocols and other ridiculous nonsense in place.” 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “This has happened before?!” Luna exclaimed. “When was the first time?” 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> Celestia averted her gaze from Luna’s and tried to walk around her sister. “Well…” she began hesitantly, “…there was about a hundred years of comfort food after… you know… moon incident…” Celestia trailed off sheepishly. She felt her cheeks burn with embarrassment. “I was an emotional wreck and… might’ve let myself go.” 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “They had to cart her to her throne in a wheel barrel.” 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> Celestia shot a murderous glare at her maid, who seemed completely indifferent to future of pain and torment that the eyes held. “Yes… we really did not need to add that, Feather Duster.” 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “Then there was the year the potato chip was invented…” Feather Duster added cheerily. 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “Thank-you but-“ 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “…and the great decade of cheesecake!” 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> Celestia was beginning to grind her teeth as she watched a smile slowly creep across her sister’s lips. 
09:11 < Mariorulez14> I've completely forgotten to check my Yahoo mail after signing up for that shitty PrizeRebel thing
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “Yes, I think Luna gets the id-“ 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “And then there was the time you discovered ponies were experimenting with food in the bedroom. The guards couldn’t get the chocolate syrup out of their coats for wee-“ 
09:11 < CH|mIRC> “OH! LOOK AT THE TIME!” Celestia shouted too loudly, using her magic to turn Feather Duster’s mouth into a zipper. She began walking to the door, dragging the maid by her tail. “I’m late for court! Fancy that! Come along, Feather Duster. Time to run Equestria!”

09:12 < CH|mIRC> Luna giggled to herself, the idea of a very round Celestia coming to her mind. “I guess thou was really tubby back then, Tia?” 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> Celestia froze in her tracks. “Don’t. You. Dare.” She whispered harshly. Luna smirked. 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> “Tubby Tia. Tubby Tubby Tia.” Luna sang in a singsong voice. 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> Oh. 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> The horseshoes were coming off. 
09:12 < CH|mIRC>  “It’s going to be the moon for you!” Celestia shouted, dropping Feather Duster, as she bolted after her sister. Luna cackled and tried to dart away to hide somewhere in the veritable sea of books, but only managed a few steps before a white cannonball barreled into her. The combined momentum sent them both crashing into a row of bookshelves, sending tomes flying everywhere. After a 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> minute of writing bodies, Celestia managed to pin Luna beneath her, and gave the moon goddess a sadistic smile. 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> “You know what’s next.”’ 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> “Ack! No! No!” Luna screamed as Celestia’s hooves came down on her. Celestia gave a crazed manic smile. Revenge was a wonderful thing to abuse. Her hooves came down again and again, moving along Luna’s smooth indigo flanks. She knew all of dear Luna’s weak spots. Tears poured from Luna’s eyes. The  princess was crying from how hard she was laughing, and clutched her sides as she 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> tried to wrestle her sister off of her. “Bwahaaha-Cel-hahaha-Tiahahaha! I-hahhahaha-yield! I yield!” Luna tapped her hoof against the floor. By now, even Celestia was giggling. 
09:12 < CH|mIRC> After another several minutes of tickle torture, Celestia let go of her sister and rolled to the side, collapsing onto the mound of books. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she could hear the librarians on the verge of having simultaneous heart attacks. That stray thought was washed away in the warm after-glow of both of their laughter.

10:08 < Darman213> TIME FOAR POETRY
10:09 < Darman213> Well shucks
10:09 < Darman213> it's not carrying the format over
10:10 < Darman213> Is there a script where it'll read off a text file?
10:10 < Darman213> line for line?
10:12 < CommanderHurricane> you could write your own script
10:13 < Darman213> Could, but that'd take more time than I have at the moment to understand what I'm doing.

10:21 < Mariorulez14|Library> History
10:21 < Darman213> A beautiful girl is hard to find
10:21 < Darman213> , When all too many are undermined.
10:21 < Darman213> what
10:21 < Darman213> .
10:21 < Darman213> A beautiful girl is hard to find, 
10:21 < Darman213> When all too many are undermined. 
10:21 < Darman213> For every man sees beauty in his eyes, 
10:21 < Darman213> and is oft subjected with many lies 
10:21 < Darman213> What is beauty? I must ask this question, 
10:21 < Darman213> Before Loving a girl is even a suggestion 
10:21 < Darman213>  
10:21 < Darman213> For man oft looks on the outside, the shell, 
10:21 < Darman213> when the minds of woman might be bent to hell. 
10:21 < Darman213>  
10:21 < Darman213> For a woman of figure, is indeed a good thought, 
10:21 < Darman213> But in the streets of the city, they are easily bought. 
10:22 < Darman213>   
10:22 < Darman213> A man shouldn't just consider her external build 
10:22 < Darman213> but also the things, in her mind, are instilled. 
10:22 < Darman213> What is the beauty without an intellect to show? 
10:22 < Darman213> Without a brain, her fancies will ebb and flow. 
10:22 < Darman213>  
10:22 < Darman213> God I pray that Every young man seeks you first, 
10:22 < Darman213> I know without your teachings my heart'd be burst. 
10:22 < Darman213>  
10:22 < Darman213> For a girl for me, will need to love you as well 
10:22 < Darman213> and show wisdom and beauty, as pearls in a shell, 
10:22 < Darman213>  
10:22 < Darman213> And like that pearl so precious, I'll ask of you, 
10:22 < Darman213> Father above, that I may find her, there on the pew  
10:22 < Darman213> We would smile and gawk, and eventually Talk, 
10:22 < Darman213> Father I pray, you'd send us on a walk. 
10:22 < Darman213> hey, it kept the formatting...
10:23 < Mariorulez14|Library> lol
10:24 < CommanderHurricane> darman213: you need to get tandy to read that
10:26 < Darman213> Yeah
10:26 < Darman213> He'll probably lol at me
10:26 < Darman213> but he'd get a hoot
10:26 < Darman213> maybe he'll gain some understanding.
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library> Here’s the development snapshot of week 6, 2012! List of changes:
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Many minor bug fixes and tweaks
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Doors have been changed to properly detect if they are open or closed. Double doors in existing maps will need to be updated
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Villagers will move indoors during night and rain, and socialize with each other
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Zombies will break down wooden doors on hard difficulty
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Added cat sounds
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Better movement for mobs in water
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library>     Added rare mob item drops
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library> ZOMBIES BREAK DOORS DOWN :D
10:27 < Mariorulez14|Library> FINALLY
10:27 < Darman213> *rare mob drops*
10:27 < Darman213> Like slimeballs?
10:27 < Darman213> xD
10:28 < CommanderHurricane> i'm thinking about upgrading the server to 12w06a
10:28 < CommanderHurricane> darman213: no, armor or weapons
10:28 < CommanderHurricane> sometimes enchanted weapons
10:28 < Darman213> but... then I'd have to re-fix my .jar and shtuff...
10:28 < Darman213> ah well
10:28 < Darman213> t'would be worth it
10:28 < Darman213> DO IT CommanderHurricane !!!
10:29 < CommanderHurricane> better idea
10:29 < CommanderHurricane> wait for a 1.2 compatible build of craftbukkit to come out
10:29 < CommanderHurricane> then ban iron doors

10:31 < Tandy|7540> Ok
10:31 < Tandy|7540> the new minecraft server map is coming along
10:31 < Tandy|7540> there's going to be three prebuilt 'zones'
10:31 < Tandy|7540> these will have 'plots'
10:32 < Darman213> >plots
10:32 < Tandy|7540> the zones are: Mountain villiage, underground villiage/mine, and castle.
10:32 < Tandy|7540> right now I'm building the mountain village one.
10:32 < Tandy|7540> Each plot will have a house and the beginnings of a mine
10:32 < Tandy|7540> as well as a chest containing:

10:34 < Tandy|7540> 1 set of iron armor, a bed, an iron sword, some food, a stack of cobble and half-stack of wood, a half-stack of torches, iron hoe, iron pickaxe, and some chicken eggs.
10:34 < Tandy|7540> The mountain village is basically just a bunch of plots connected with a wooden arial walkway
10:34 < Mariorulez14|Library> right-click the #whatever

11:46 < Darman213> I shed a few man tears over that book
11:46 < Mariorulez14|Library> It was the best idea ever to convert them to MP3 with high-quality
11:47 < Mariorulez14|Library> <Darman213> I shed a few man tears over that book
11:47 < Mariorulez14|Library> You should have seen me when I read Their Eyes Were Watching God

12:23 < Mariorulez14|Library> Kind of
12:23 < Mariorulez14|Library> Except you have to analyze the story instead of describing the story
12:23 < Darman213> And the rhetorical values of it
12:23 < Darman213> and the significance of things
12:24 < Darman213> and the meaning of life according to the author

07:33 < Tandy|Shuttle> OH LOOK IT'S VALENTINES DAY AND I'M SINGLE.
07:33 < Tandy|Shuttle> Time to go get drunk.
07:33 < Tandy|Shuttle> Oh, wait. Unconstitutional Unitard States laws prevent me from doing that.
07:33 < Tandy|Shuttle> Damn, now I'm more depressed ._.
07:34 <+binki> O_o
07:34 <+binki> not sure that getting drunk would be a good option regardless
07:34 <+binki> but not being able to have any drink at all is a bit ridiculous
07:35 < Tandy|Shuttle> Yeah, the point of that whole post was mostly "Preventing people from doing what they want to their own body is completely unconstitutional"
07:37 <+binki> not sure what the constitution has to do with it; it's just state law, right?
07:39 < Tandy|Shuttle> We have a right to life, property, and the pursuit of happiness.
07:40 < Tandy|Shuttle> My body is my property, and (hypothetically) booze makes me happy.
07:40 < Tandy|Shuttle> Thus, according to the ideals this country was founded on, I should be able to get wasted.
07:40 < Tandy|Shuttle> Not saying I want to, I'm saying I should be able to.
07:43 <+binki> that constitutional right should only apply to the laws Congress makes, you're supposed to be able to move to the particular state which has the laws which suit you best
07:44 <+binki> and get those laws into the state legislature and all that
07:44 <+binki> I'm just speaking in terms of how I think things were meant to be ;-)

17:33 <+binki> silliness, seamonkey2.5 (ok, 2.7.1 is the latest release) can't handle <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-2.dtd">
17:33 <+binki> it doesn't know that HTML entities may be used with that DOCTYPE
17:33 <+binki> so it errors out on `&raquo;' which is valid and defined in the .dtd
17:38 < CommanderHurricane> maybe seamonkey 2.7 knows about xhtml+rdfa?
17:39 -!- CH|mIRC [neko_mirc@350C711.9EBBA8CC.6D2E2761.IP] has quit [Quit: ]
17:39 <+binki> yeah
17:39 <+binki> I'll upgrade eventually
17:42 <+binki> "Gates then used a computer at the University of Washington to produce the traffic flow charts. (Paul Allen's father was a librarian at UW.) This was the beginning of Traf-O-Data"
17:42 <+binki> unfair advantage :-p
17:43 <+binki> well
17:43 <+binki> I could just completely get rid of all HTML entities on http://ccel.org/ and coerce everything into UTC-8
17:43 <+binki> and then perhaps we'd be closer to Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
17:44 <+binki> but I don't think they would appreciate me trying to do that sort of thing
17:44 <+binki> time to mess with CSV so I can finish adding Hope College to slate_permutate
17:45 < `> binki: add Crafton Hills College
17:45 < `> :D
17:45 < `> http://www.crafton.edu/
17:46 <+binki> NXDOMAIN
17:46 <+binki> http://craftonhills.edu/
17:46 < `> ugh
17:47 <+binki> :-p
17:47 < `> i hate it when they dont include WWW records
17:47 <+binki> oh, http://www.craftonhills.edu/ most probably works too and they redirect to www.
17:47 <+binki> just http://no-www.org/ :-p
17:48 < `> yeah
17:48 < `> i do no-www
17:48 < `> i just do the proper redirects and rewrites
17:48 < `> :)
17:49 <+binki> but did you actually type out that URL and include the www.? I avoid that whenever I can :-p
17:49 <+binki> this keyboard seems to actually require effort to push the keys, maybe my hands are just cold, hmm
17:49 < `> nope
17:49 < `> i didn't
17:49 < `> copypasta
17:50 <+binki> http://www.craftonhills.edu/eSchedule/Online/Schedule/C/index.html
17:50 <+binki> from where?
17:50 <+binki> they used to own that other domain?
17:50 < `> ?
17:50 < `> even if you do http://craftonhills.edu/
17:50 < `> it redirects to www.craftonhills.edu
17:50 <+binki> yeah
17:50  * ` shrugs
17:50 <+binki> but where'd you copy&paste http://www.crafton.edu/ from?
17:50 <+binki> :-p
17:51 <+binki> so many clicks/page load to get to http://www.craftonhills.edu/eSchedule/Online/Schedule/C/2012SP/Accounting_49794.html
17:51 <+binki> no college we have yet requires a page load per course
17:51 <+binki> is there a better interface?
17:51 < `> no, sadly.
17:51 < `> lol
17:51 < `> their system is fucked up
17:51 < `> hence why slate_permutate would probably be useful
17:51 < `> idk
17:53 <+binki> I want to support all colleges possible
17:53 <+binki> so we "should" hit that one eventually anyways ;-)

18:45 < CommanderHurricane> alright
18:45 < CommanderHurricane> let's install Windows Developer Preview on the AMDerp
18:46 < CommanderHurricane> since Metro is hardware accellerated, i expect it to fail miserably on the AMDerp's integrated graphics
18:46 < `> lol
18:46 < `> g'luck
18:46 < Compgeke> lol
18:46 < Compgeke> I installed it on a 633 MHz Celeron with 128 megs ram
18:47 < `> >128m of ram
18:47 < `> IMPOSSIBRU!
18:47 < CommanderHurricane> hmm, something tells me the installation won't go well if i don't plug in the hard drive
18:48 < Compgeke> lol
18:48 < Compgeke> I installed using 512 megs of ram, dropped to 384, then to 256 then to 128

19:40 < CommanderHurricane> Spike grunted as another shower of sparks burst across his thick chest plating.
19:40 < CommanderHurricane> “Spikey!” Pinkie Pie cried. Fluttershy flinched away from the sight, moaning into Rarity’s shoulder. The unicorn was looking up at the dragon with an expression of deep concern.
19:40 < CommanderHurricane> “It’s fine,” Spike said, through gritted teeth, trying to smile. “This is nothing…I live in the same house with her …been turned into worse…”

19:46 < Mariorulez14> DOHOHO
19:51 < CommanderHurricane> Luna, her eyes blazing white with terrible power, screamed her agony. The magic lacing the howl of terror gave it an all-consuming, ear-shattering pressure that caused the ponies in the chamber to stagger and moan as their teeth ached and heads throbbed.
19:51 < CommanderHurricane> Spike shied away from the pain, but resolutely held Twilight’s head slightly proud of Celestia’s as the princess had ordered even though the bursts of magical sparks had appeared to have stopped. His chest scales were scored and burned here and there; no worse than they had been before, as he’d said, but in much more trying circumstances than he had ever wished. 
19:51 < CommanderHurricane> Though his sensitive ears rang painfully, he was watching Luna carefully and uncomfortably, little snakes of green smoke leaking between his teeth. Weird energies, black and yet not black, swirled around the Princess as her deepest fear assaulted her, relentlessly.
19:51 < CommanderHurricane> Angry red welts raised on Twilight’s side, like she’d been beaten. Spike’s eye opened wide in terrified anger, for the first time, really roared, fury at his confusion and impotence fueling the very first sounding of the proud war-cry that lived in his draconic heart; but it was barely audible over the banshee howl of the princess as darkness threatened to consume her.
19:54 <+binki> .
19:55 <+binki> ``Spike?s eye opened wide in terrified anger, for the first time, really roared'' <-- missing ``and he, for the first time, really roared''
19:56 < Mariorulez14> wat is dis
19:56 <+binki> !
19:57 <+binki> so
19:57 <+binki> you provide CSV to someone with all of your course data in it
19:57 <+binki> you decide that if data doesn't all fit in a line, you put additional data on the next lines
19:57 <+binki> but you leave all other fields except for the ones with more data blank
19:57 <+binki> so that the parser/(or slate_permutate crawler) has to manually remember what the previous line was like !
19:57 <+binki> argh
19:58 <+binki> this is just the thing that makes the crawlers harder to read

21:23 <+binki> ok, slate_permutate's Hope College crawler is really terrible
21:24 <+binki> they have a lot of metadata in this freeform text field such as what courses the course is crosslisted with or whether or not that course needs a lab
21:24 <+binki> which is quite a bother
21:24 <+binki> I can't even detect if a course is a lab or not, I don't think
21:25 <+binki> not that slate_permutate even recognizes that it's possible to cross-list courses
21:45 <+binki> let's see if facebook can automatically tell me which of my friends go to hope college...
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> well
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> lol
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> that was amusing
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> ate at olive garden, afterwards I felt restless
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> thus, I ran the length of the strip mall parking lot (about 1/2 mile, it's a bigass lot) to Target. I intended to run back (I sprinted), but my full stomach got rather painful
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> so I arrive at Target, pull out my phone, call mom and say "This wasn't my best laid plan. Come pick me up."
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> I hang up and people were staring at me
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> I realized
21:45 <~Tandy|7540> <Tandy|7540> Here's this dude dressed completely in black that runs up hauling ass down the parking lot, stops, pulls out a phone and starts talking about plans.

21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:40 PM - Sugarhigh: You are now the Dragonborn. You awake in a hazy stupor, to find yourself in a rickety wooden cart, surrounded by three men. A man turns to you, ane begins to speak. What do you do?
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:41 PM - Mariorulez14: Try to take the pumpkin he's holding out to me
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:43 PM - Sugarhigh: You do not seem to be thinking clearly. The man does not seem to be holding out a pumpkin. In fact, he couldn't very well hold anything out. His hands are bound tightly, as well as the other two men. You look down to find that your hands are also quite thoroughly bound. The man continues speaking.
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:44 PM - Mariorulez14: Listen to the person speaking
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:52 PM - Sugarhigh: You listen to the man speak, but begin drifting off after a short time. You survey your surroundings. A lush forest, not unlike the ones you are accustomed to at home. Home... You try to remember where you're from, but can't seem to conjure up any information through your slight stupor.
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:54 PM - Mariorulez14: Think for a while and decide to be John Doe until I can think of a good name
21:52 < Mariorulez14> Doe until I can think of a good name
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:56 PM - Sugarhigh: You decide to call yourself John Doe for the time being, but don't care much for the name. You realize that the man is still droning on and on, so you decide to toss the strange-accented dog a bone and listen in for a while. You apparently had one rough night. Borderhopping, getting sacked by Imperials, and being dragged off and imprisoned. You were then promptly shipped off for execution.
21:52 < Mariorulez14> 8:56 PM - Mariorulez14: Try and break these cuffs

22:17 < Mariorulez14> A whole 2-liter
22:18 < CommanderHurricane> ._.
22:18 < CommanderHurricane> well, i know who's not going to go to sleep tonight
22:20 < Mariorulez14> The funny part is that caffiene has an adverse affect
22:20 < Mariorulez14> In the sense that it either doesn't affect me or makes me hella tired

22:20 < Mariorulez14> I'm gonna have to take a serious piss in the morning though, I'll tell you what ._.

22:23 < Mariorulez14> Still has caffiene somehow
22:23 <+binki> all the worse :-p
22:23 <+binki> you can't have cola without caffiene, that wouldn't make any sense :-p
22:23 < Mariorulez14> Tell that to the blasphemous Caffiene-Free Diet Coke
22:24 < Mariorulez14> That's one of the reasons I drink Pepsi, the other is that I'm biased to since my dad works for PepsiCo

22:24 < Compgeke> I guess that works
22:25 <+binki> yeah, it's sorta the difference between lipton tea and red rose tea possibly
22:25 < Compgeke> although I hate the auto stuff...lets figure out how to disable it
22:25 <+binki> but I chose to be biased towards coke and lipton ;-)

22:26 < Compgeke> this is the 1994 UK remaster of The Wall

08:20 <+binki> I think that I'll just test if (^|[^a-z])lab(r|[^a-z]) exists in the section's title, since all sections which are labs say so in the title
08:21 <+binki> need to come up with some better SEO-oriented descriptions/taglines for slate_permutate, though

08:23 <+binki> oh, one thing that slate_permutate _needs_ is indicating course titles in its autocomplete listings
08:23 <+binki> that way you don't actually have to remember the course number
08:23 <+binki> but I guess I should try to do actual homework now :-/
08:25 <~Tandy|7540> "Valentines day music time! Do you have an unhealthy obsession with Twilight Sparkle and have spent the last 18 hours thinking about falling asleep in her hooves?! Then for today, welcome home! "
08:25 <~Tandy|7540> ^wat
08:25 <+binki> I think I should run a script to see if http://plus.hope.edu/ is _always_ down throughout the night... like, to see if its 503s are on purpose instead of just accidental
08:26 <+binki> tandy|7540: that's taking it way too far, lol
08:27 <+binki> http://hope.edu/registrar/ <-- there used to be something that made sense at that URL last saturday
08:28 <+binki> now it appears that hope's website is in the middle of being completely broken by its IT staff or something
08:28 <+binki> I was actually interested in trying to further decipher their course meeting time listings, lol
08:29 <+binki> (14:30:43) Katie Wallinga: why, were you looking at HOPE???
08:29 <+binki> (14:30:59) ohnobinki@chat.facebook.com/87728878_4B8F9D2F6CC16: because slate_permutate, if it supports calvin, should of course support hope
08:29 <+binki> (14:31:05) ohnobinki@chat.facebook.com/87728878_4B8F9D2F6CC16: we're going for world domination here

08:31 <+binki> not sure about saying `love ya bro' to a cousin, this younger generation's using a whole different revision of English apparently

08:38 < Mariorulez14>   Here’s the development snapshot of week 7, 2012! List of changes:
08:38 < Mariorulez14> Added new world file format called “Anvil” (256 max height and 4096 block IDs*)
08:38 < Mariorulez14> Multi-player light calculations do no longer cause affected blocks to be transmitted to the clients, instead the clients will recalculate the light on their own
08:38 < Mariorulez14> Villagers will repopulate villages based on how many houses there are available
08:38 < Mariorulez14> Some nights in villages will be worse than others…
08:38 < Mariorulez14> Added a redstone-controlled light source
08:38 < Mariorulez14> Decreased chance for the rare mob drops
08:38 < Mariorulez14> All animals use the new AI system now
08:38 < Mariorulez14> >some nights worse than others...

08:47 < Mariorulez14> I need to do that with several of my current wallpapers
08:47 <~Tandy|7540> <tidux|haiku> wow, this isn't creepy at all: I plug in my dumbphone to Haiku, and the USB storage device shows up as full of Windows software set to autorun

17:08 < CommanderHurricane> http://www.betaarchive.com/wiki/index.php?title=File%3AMSDN_May_2001_Disc_0785.jpg
17:08 < Mariorulez14> You're running 90
17:08 < Mariorulez14> *95
17:08 < Mariorulez14> On a computer like that?
17:08 < Fatal-Error> hell no, 7 pro x64
17:08 < Mariorulez14> Then you mentioned VMs
17:09 < Fatal-Error> I'm running DOS in the PC I'm talking to you from now.
17:11 < CommanderHurricane> http://goput.it/mfl.jpg
17:11 < CommanderHurricane> you can see i have a lot of physical media
17:12 < Fatal-Error> Not really, my screen card is text-only.
17:12 < CommanderHurricane> there is that
17:13 < Fatal-Error> OS/2????
17:13 < CommanderHurricane> yep
17:13 < Fatal-Error> Is it as slow as its made out to be?
17:14 < CommanderHurricane> i've barely used OS/2, so i can't say for sure
17:14 < Fatal-Error> I think I new VM is in order, I need to try it out for myself
17:16 < CommanderHurricane> OS/2 proper doesn't like VMs
17:17 < CommanderHurricane> i think eComStation is a little better with VMs than IBM OS/2
17:17 < Fatal-Error> Surely QEMU or BOCHS could do it?
17:18 < CommanderHurricane> i know with OS/2 2.0 you'll get COUNTRY.SYS errors or floppy drive access errors if you try to use QEMU or Bochs
17:18 < CommanderHurricane> i do remember there was a patch out there for Bochs that would let you install OS/2 2.0 though
17:19 < CommanderHurricane> let's see if i can find it
17:20 < CommanderHurricane> hm, i found some patched virtual hard disks of OS/2 1.x for Bochs or Oracle VirtualBox
17:22 < CommanderHurricane> k dinner
17:22 < Fatal-Error> Well, I'm downloading the ecomstation demo to try. reactOS too. I'll look up OS/2 later.

20:35 <+binki> I might bug you about that until you do ;-)
20:38 -!- CH|Away[TwisLibrary] is now known as CommanderHurricane
20:38  * Compgeke wonders where everyone has been
20:38  * Compgeke needs to know of a good IRC server for DOS
20:38 < CommanderHurricane> /dev/null
20:38 < Compgeke> so you guys have been deleted pretty much?
20:38 < CommanderHurricane> well, there's RockIRCd or IRCDLITE for MS-DOS
20:39 < Compgeke> hmm...how about OS/2?
20:39 < CommanderHurricane> both are written by Mike Chambers of rubbermallet.org
20:39 < Compgeke> or Mac OS 8
20:39 < CommanderHurricane> >Mac OS 8
20:39 < CommanderHurricane> >Server
20:39 < CommanderHurricane> lolno
20:40 < CommanderHurricane> i can't find any IRCds for OS/2 right off
20:40 < Compgeke> I found a client
20:41 < Compgeke> for OS 8
20:41 < CommanderHurricane> probably IRCle
20:41 < CommanderHurricane> that's pretty much your only option for classic mac os
20:42 < Compgeke> lol
20:42 < Compgeke> I want to make use of some old computer
20:42 < Compgeke> but I can't find anything to do other than an IRC server
20:43 < CommanderHurricane> you could install Windows 95 and run an IRC server off of that
20:43 < CommanderHurricane> just be sure to restart the server every 49.7 days
20:43 < Compgeke> true
20:43 < Compgeke> or NT3
20:44 < Compgeke> but I can't find a stupid...forget it, lets install NT3
20:44 < CommanderHurricane> i should try building a 386-era machine and stick Windows NT October 1991 on it
20:44 < Compgeke> I'm sure I can find 3Com drivers for NT3
20:44 < CommanderHurricane> then try writing an IRCd for it
20:44 < Compgeke> I have my 386 motherboard
20:45 < Compgeke> but the problem is it always boots
20:45 < Compgeke> UNTIL I stick it in a case
20:45 < CommanderHurricane> could be a grounding issue or something
20:45 < CommanderHurricane> one of my servers had a sheet of plastic in between the motherboard and case 
20:45 < Compgeke> interesting
20:46 < Compgeke> I've tried 3 different cases, and the same
20:46 < Compgeke> it won't even load the BIOS (no post codes)
20:46 < CommanderHurricane> you tried a cardboard box yet? :P
20:46 < Compgeke> nope
20:46 < Compgeke> just tried sticking it on the table a few times
20:46 < Compgeke> always works
20:47 < Compgeke> it even works with the 256kb SIMMs I have
20:47 < CommanderHurricane> here's an idea
20:47 < CommanderHurricane> mount it to your wall
20:47 < Compgeke> meh, I'm mopving
20:47 < Compgeke> moving*
20:50 < Compgeke> NT4 should run on a 66 MHz 486 DX right?
20:50 < Compgeke> I think so
20:51 < CommanderHurricane> Win2k will run on a 66MHz 486DX...
20:51 < Compgeke> it has 48 MB ram anyways, it should run great
20:51 < Compgeke> lol
20:51 < Compgeke> 48 megs...that was a LOT back in 1995
20:52 < CommanderHurricane> it was
20:52 < Compgeke> lets go make some NT4 boot disks (this doesn't support CD booting)
20:53 < CommanderHurricane> and no one ever suspected we would ever hit the RAM limitations of the 386
20:53 < CommanderHurricane> even my old copy of A+ Certification basically said that 4GB of RAM was an insane amount and that no one would ever need that much
20:58 < CommanderHurricane> hmm
20:58 < CommanderHurricane> apparently my thinkpad has a 32nm Sandy Bridge Core i3 in it
20:59 < CommanderHurricane> so that's nice
21:04 < Compgeke> TAKE THE STUPID DISK DRIVE
21:04 < Compgeke> it's stupid SCSI CD burner keeps spitting the disk tray out :/
21:05 < Compgeke> I might go grab a plain SCSI CD-ROM from one of the macs
21:05  * CommanderHurricane hands compgeke a roll of duct tape
21:05 < Compgeke> "timeout failure during SCSI Inquiry Command"
21:06 < Compgeke> What exactly does that mean?
21:06  * Compgeke goes to google
21:08 < Compgeke> I'm willing to bed the drive is dead
21:16 <~Tandy|7540> ohai
21:16 <~Tandy|7540> I'm willing to bed anything that's willing.

21:38 < Compgeke> fucking PCA
21:38 < Compgeke> my advice for that thread is to pick it up about neck level and drop it on the ground
21:40 < CommanderHurricane> that'd do it
21:40 < Compgeke> OR talk to the school and actually show them what is wrong...it's not hard to point something out. just bitching about it will get nothing done

21:53 < Compgeke> why does my LS 120 drive sound like there is a bad disk in it?
21:53 < Compgeke> this disk is known good...I just wrote to it
21:55 < Compgeke> and it's writing slower than crap...I need the rest of my power supply cabbles
21:55 < Compgeke> so I can stick a floppy drive in here
22:04 < CommanderHurricane> found an old SO-DIMM laying around
22:04 < CommanderHurricane> well, i guess i know what i'm going to pump 12vdc into tomorrow
22:05 < CommanderHurricane> if it's not raining that is
22:08 < Compgeke> lol
22:09 <~Tandy|7540> wow
22:09 <~Tandy|7540> this 383 1 20 stuff
22:09 <~Tandy|7540> is amazing for tunneling :D
22:09 <~Tandy|7540> right mouse button + "w"
22:09 < CommanderHurricane> Tandy|7540: you can use ender crystals as well
22:10 < CommanderHurricane> set a bunch of them up in a line, break one and it'll cause a chain reaction
22:11 <~Tandy|7540> ender crystals?
22:11 < Compgeke> DAMN IT! I NEED A FLOPPY DRIVE
22:11 < CommanderHurricane> Tandy|7540: those things in The End that the Enderdragon gets health from
22:12 <~Tandy|7540> huh
22:12 <~Tandy|7540> interesting
22:12 <~Tandy|7540> how do I spawn those?
22:13 < CommanderHurricane> /give Tandyman100 383 1 200
22:13 <~Tandy|7540> what's the advantage of them over tnt?
22:13 < CommanderHurricane> no fire/redstone required to set them off, larger blast radius

08:15 <~Tandy|7540> Darman213: uh, ok?
08:15 <~Tandy|7540> "Valentines day is about Love. Now, you may get too wrapped up in the Idea that love is this exclusive thing between a man and a woman, but it's not. Love is something we can all share. Love can be just giving a hug to someone that needs it, or listening to someone who needs to talk. So before you go out saying "Valentines Day is Aweful", Think about the love people share with you, and you with them. And for my 
08:15 <~Tandy|7540> seen it
08:15 <~Tandy|7540> your point?

08:20 <~Tandy|7540> any new developments on the mienkraft server?
08:20 <~Tandy|7540> ...what
08:20 <~Tandy|7540> lol
08:21 <~Tandy|7540> I'm extending The Core
08:21 < Mariorulez14> The Core?
08:21 <~Tandy|7540> I added an Arcane Sciences research facility
08:21 <~Tandy|7540> and I'm adding an aboveground observation facility
08:21 < CommanderHurricane> http://www.beige-box.com/images/ponies/art/luna_in_socks_by_windfallpony-d426v0w.jpg
08:21 < CommanderHurricane> k
08:21 <~Tandy|7540> both are accessable by minecart because they're down a BLOODY LONG HALLWAY ._.
08:21 < CommanderHurricane> i can just fly there
08:22 <~Tandy|7540> it's underground and minecarts are more fun
08:22 <~Tandy|7540> I need to make some cool piston stuff
08:22 < CommanderHurricane> >aboveground ovservation facility
08:22 < CommanderHurricane> >is underground
08:22 <~Tandy|7540> oh
08:22 <~Tandy|7540> well
08:22 < CommanderHurricane> observation*
08:22 < Mariorulez14> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8el_P4yvfc&feature=relmfu
08:22 <~Tandy|7540> that's just a small part of the whole facility
08:23 <~Tandy|7540> and I think I might remove the minecart..
08:23 <~Tandy|7540> build a piston people mover.
08:23 <~Tandy|7540> rather
08:23 <~Tandy|7540> remove the minecart to the arcane research center
08:23 < Mariorulez14> Simon Cowell is...the Beaver King?
08:23 < Mariorulez14> wat
08:23 <~Tandy|7540> and the one that goes to the observation facility
08:23 <~Tandy|7540> instead have some sort of piston elevator/automatic stairs
08:24 <~Tandy|7540> actually, new plan.
08:24 <~Tandy|7540> Just start building :P
08:24 <~Tandy|7540> I wish minecraft had more science-y stuff
08:24 <~Tandy|7540> and technology
08:25 < Mariorulez14> >Minechem mod makes elements a reality but Tandyman Syndrome prevents craftbukkit from being on the server
08:25 < Mariorulez14> Seriously, you can make Thermite
08:25 < Mariorulez14> And it burns through EVERYTHING
08:27 < CommanderHurricane> it's not tandyman syndrome
08:27 < CommanderHurricane> it's the fact that if you install plugins to bukkit, everyone who connects has to have the same mods installed
08:28 < Darman213> ^
08:29 < Mariorulez14> Well I can get you all instructions to install Mo' Creatures

08:29 <~Tandy|7540> http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/fic/src/132937083282.png
08:29 <~Tandy|7540> this is accurate
08:29 <~Tandy|7540> <CommanderHurricane> it's the fact that if you install plugins to bukkit, everyone who connects has to have the same mods installed
08:29 <~Tandy|7540> this
08:30 <~Tandy|7540> one way I could get around that is have a pre-modded minecraft.jar available for download
08:30 <~Tandy|7540> but that's technically illegal
08:30 <~Tandy|7540> and personally I end up re-installing minecraft a lot. I don't want to have to mod it each time (lol 7zip to unzip .jars) every damn time just so I can connect to my own server ._.
08:30 < Mariorulez14> I can e-mail you my minecraft.jar with Rei's Minimap Mod and Mo' Creatures

10:08 < Mariorulez14> Yes, but by today's standards that's as frikkin immortal as it gets
10:09 < Mariorulez14> Seeing as life expectancy is going down apparently
10:09 < CommanderHurricane> Tandy|Shuttle: yeh, immortality might sound good but it's not really all that great
10:09 < Mariorulez14> Well yeah
10:09 < Mariorulez14> All your friends around you get old while you stay young
10:10 < Mariorulez14> Friends die constantly
10:10 < Mariorulez14> You'd see some crazy shit, like the ent of teh wrolds
10:10 < Mariorulez14> And yet, I still have an irrational fear of dying
10:13 < Tandy|Shuttle> I don't mind dying
10:13 < Tandy|Shuttle> I do mind pain.
10:13 < Mariorulez14> ^
10:13 < Tandy|Shuttle> Dying prematurely would suck, tho]
10:13 < Mariorulez14> I'm honestly scared to death of dying (no pun intended)
10:13 < Mariorulez14> Also making new thread in Pony boards
10:14 < CommanderHurricane> i have no fears of death

12:43 < Tandy|Shuttle> I'm about to work on the library and resturaunt
12:44 < Darman|Work> nice

12:44 < Tandy|Shuttle> My server.
12:45 < Darman|Work> Noice
12:45 < Tandy|Shuttle> yup
12:45 < Tandy|Shuttle> after the resturaunt and library, I'll work on the railroad connecting Mountain Village (I really need a new name) with Bedrock.
12:45 < Tandy|Shuttle> Airville?
12:45 < Tandy|Shuttle> Sky City?
12:45 < CommanderHurricane> nah
12:45 < Tandy|Shuttle> Wood Town Built On Some Mountains?
12:46 < CommanderHurricane> save Airville or Sky City until after 1.2 comes out
12:46 < CommanderHurricane> then you can quite literally build them in the sky
12:46 < Tandy|Shuttle> lol yeah
12:46 < CommanderHurricane> NAME IT DIRTVILLE

12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> I went in this morning, the railroad to Mountain was missing.
12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> well
12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> it was obviously someone not in creative
12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> which means you.
12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> checking the logs, you were the only one logged in that doesn't have creative mode.
12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> y u grief, neko?
12:47 < Tandy|Shuttle> :'(
12:48 < CommanderHurricane> because messing with you is fun
12:48 < CommanderHurricane> also you have no ruleset
12:48 < Tandy|Shuttle> That's partially because the server isn't *finished* yet
12:48 < Tandy|Shuttle> right now the only reason it's online is so people can help me *build* the place
12:48 < Tandy|Shuttle> then I set absolutely EVERYONE (myself included) to Survival

13:26 < CommanderHurricane> i tried setting it up to just kick but then mIRC threw script errors
13:30 < Mariorulez14> And again I say, this is stupid
13:30 < CommanderHurricane> and binki is the one who owns ohnopub.net, the irc server that both retro-box and beige-box are linked to

18:12 < `> yup
18:12 < Kel> I'm going to Monarch in Colorado,
18:12 < Kel> ittybitty

18:12 < `> it's the "home" park of Shaun White
18:13 < `> he boarded there all the time before he went pro
18:13 < Kel> Bear? niiiice!
18:14 < `> according to wikipedia:
18:14 < `> White spent his formative years riding Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain, small ski resorts found in Ludlow, Vermont, and the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California.
18:15 < `> :D
18:15 < `> I met him at one time, he was pretty cool.
18:15 < Kel> no way!
18:15 < Kel> completely jealous!
18:16 < `> A friend of mine who boards nearly everyday knew him, so when I was boarding with my friend, we bumped into White and said sup, how's the powder, etc
18:16 < Kel> ... :o
18:16 < `> my friend was hard of hearing (deaf, but can hear "enough" to speak to people)
18:16 < `> :P

18:38 <+binki> I wasted enough time to do ohnobinki@ohnopublishing ~/unreal-hg-2011.12.02 $ ( PN=wgetpaste; PV=2.18; P=${PN}-${PV}; source /usr/portage/app-text/${PN}/${P}.ebuild ; echo $SRC_URI; )
18:38 <+binki> http://wgetpaste.zlin.dk/wgetpaste-2.18.tar.bz2
18:38 <+binki> lol
18:39 < `> wasted time to do WHAT
18:40 <+binki> to write  ( PN=wgetpaste; PV=2.18; P=${PN}-${PV}; source /usr/portage/app-text/${PN}/${P}.ebuild ; echo $SRC_URI; )
18:40  * ` doesn't get that.
18:40 <+binki> probably because you don't use Gentoo :-p
18:40 < `> nope, lol
18:40 -!- niner [IceChat77@undisclosed-E3CA8316.dsl.wchtks.swbell.net] has quit [Quit: I'm gone deal with it]
18:40 < `> debian dude, here
18:40 <+binki> I'm trying to show off my not bash skills :-p
18:41 <+binki> lolyeah
18:41  * ` pets ssh-copy-id
18:41 <+binki> yeah, I didn't even know that that utility existed until about a month ago
18:42 <+binki> but I probably won't have an opportunity to use it anytime soon... I always did it the manual cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys way
18:42 < `> :P
18:42 < `> also
18:42 < `> how do i properly configure the script to use dpaste
18:43 < `> and completely ignore pastebin?
18:43 <+binki> I through SERVICE=dpaste into /etc/wgetpaste.conf
18:43 <+binki> *throw
18:43 < `> so basically
18:43 <+binki> wgetpaste even yells at you when you try to paste something big which dpaste normally rejects
18:43 < `> echo SERVICE=dpaste > /etc/wgetpaste.conf
18:44 <+binki> yup
18:44 < `> so i call it as wgetpaste
18:44 <+binki> yup
18:44 < `> or can i rename the script to soemthing simpler
18:44 <+binki> stdin or wit ha filename
18:44 < `> i.e. spam
18:44 < `> cat whatever | spam
18:44 <+binki> you might as well, it's up to you :-p
18:44 <+binki> meani
18:44 <+binki> e
18:45 < `> just an example
18:45 <+binki> :-p
18:45 < `> i want to be able to just quickly type it out
18:45 < `> than type out "wgetpaste"
18:46 <+binki> I suspect that people would recommend something like `alias wp=wgetpaste' in your .bashrc
18:46 <+binki> instead of actually just renaming the script :-p
18:46 < `> wp
18:46 < `> wp is much better
18:46 < `> wg
18:46 <+binki> makes me think of wordpress, though
18:46 < `> yeah, me too :|
18:46 < `> wgp?
18:47 <+binki> lol, it's your computer not mine!
18:47 <+binki> or dp=wgetpaste since you dpaste with it
18:47 < `> yeah
18:47 < `> that makes much more sense
18:48 <+binki> you're just trying to flatter me
18:48 <+binki> :-p
18:48 < `> no, really
18:49 < `> k
18:52 < `> there we go
18:53 < `> alias dp='/usr/bin/wgetpaste'
18:53 < `> lets see if that works
18:53 < `> nope
18:53 < `> it doesn't want to work
18:53 <+binki> lol
18:54 < `> however, if i call uptime | wgetpaste
18:54 < `> works fine.
18:54 <+binki> http://dpaste.com/704204/
18:54 < `> where's wgetpaste on your system?
18:55 <+binki> somewheres in $PATH, /usr/bin/wgetpaste
18:55 < `> hmm
18:55 < `> maybe aliases dont like using absolute paths
18:55 <+binki> how does it fail for you?
18:55 <+binki> no
18:55 <+binki> I think I've seen exmples of abs paths with aliases before
18:55 < `> root@blackmagic:~# uptime | dp
18:55 < `> -bash: dp: command not found
18:56 <+binki> did you actually execute `alias dp=wgetpaste' in your current shell?
18:56 < `> i shoved it into .bashrc
18:56 <+binki> if you just appended it to .bashrc or whatever, you must still do `source ~/.bashrc' in your existing shell
18:56 <+binki> .bashrc is only read at startup :-p
19:01 <+binki> maybe that was one cup too many of tea, maybe not
19:01 < `> it works.
19:01 < `> :D
19:01 <+binki> :-)
19:02 <+binki> so, if you want to specify the syntax highlighting you'd use the -l option
19:02 <+binki> dp -L to list the available syntaxes
19:03 <+binki> e.g., git format-patch --stdout HEAD^ | dp -lDiff
19:03 < `> :P
19:03 <+binki> or, for slate_permutate, hg export tip | dp -lDiff
19:08 < `> :P
19:08 < `> it works just fine.
19:09 < `> and is much better than sprunge
19:09 < `> sprunge is real simple, but yeah
19:11 <+binki> :-)
19:21 < `> i'm doing subtle changes to wgetpaste
19:21 < `> lol
19:24 < `> i love the fact that i can call it from within irssi
19:24 < `>  /exec -o echo "Hello World!" | dp
19:24 < `> :P
19:27 <+binki> lol, that's ridiculous
19:27 <+binki> but if you're pasting a _file_ from within irssi that'd save the copying of the URI
19:28 < `> exactly
19:28 <+binki> wgetpaste -o /etc/wgetpaste.conf
19:28 <+binki> stupid me
19:28 <+binki> Your paste can be seen here: http://dpaste.com/704222/
19:28 <+binki> ah
19:28 <+binki> nice
19:28 < `> exactly.
19:28 < `> :P
19:28 < `> i paste a bit on irc
19:28 < `> so its real useful
19:32 < `> i also modified it in a such way
19:32 < `> that it says less
19:32 <+binki> nice :-p
19:32  * binki lives with how it's written
19:36 < `> /bin/sh: dp: not found
19:36 < `> cat: write error: Broken pipe
19:36 < `> ugh
19:37 < `> /bin/sh: dp: not found
19:37 < `> cat: write error: Broken pipe
19:37 < `> damn thing
19:37 < `> Copypasta pasted to: http://dpaste.com/704225/
19:37 < `> :P
19:38 <+binki> lol
19:38 <+binki> I'd be more interested in a diff :-p
19:39 < `> lol
19:39 < `> how do i do a diff?
19:39 <+binki> get the original and put it somewheres
19:39 < `> mhmm, and?
19:40 <+binki> then diff -u /path/to/original/wegetpaste-1.18/wgetpaste /usr/bin/wgetpaste | dp -lDiff
19:40 <+binki> -u for unified diff, the format which people actually use
19:41 < `> /usr/bin/wgetpaste: unrecognized option `-f'
19:41 < `> this is what i used
19:41 < `> root@blackmagic:~/wgetpaste-2.18# diff -u wgetpaste /usr/bin/wgetpaste | dp -lDiff
19:42 <+binki> lol, let's see what manner of stupidness I am having
19:42 < `> fixed it
19:42 < `> supposed to be a space between -l and Diff
19:43 <+binki> -l Diff
19:43 <+binki> yes
19:43 < `> Copypasta pasted to: http://dpaste.com/704226/
19:43 < `> basic edit.
19:43 < `> :P
19:43 <+binki> :-)
19:44 <+binki> I'm too lazy to look for even simple edits though, there's the diff tool to do that for me :-p

20:18 < Darman213> Hey Compgeke|3G !!
20:18 < Darman213> hory sheet
20:18 < Darman213> It's dead in here ._.
20:18 < Compgeke|3G> what?
20:19 <~Tandy|Shuttle> <`> my o:line mysteriously disappeared.
20:19 <~Tandy|Shuttle> <`> either that, or i'm all herpderp and doing it wrong
20:19 < Compgeke|3G> man, Logmein is quite slow on 3G...
20:19 <~Tandy|Shuttle> sean left.
20:19 < `> what?
20:19 <~Tandy|Shuttle> he delinked and left.
20:19 < `> you serious?
20:19 < `> what happened?
20:20 <~Tandy|Shuttle> he got pissed
20:20 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I got sick of his crap
20:21 <~Tandy|Shuttle> deactivated his Retronet BBS account, banned him from *my* minecraft server
20:21 <~Tandy|Shuttle> so he delinked.
20:21 <~Tandy|Shuttle> SHALL I TELL THE WHOLE STORY?
20:21 < Compgeke|3G> yes
20:21 <+binki> tandy|shuttle: learned PHP yet?
20:21 <~Tandy|Shuttle> IN THE BEGINNING
20:21 <~Tandy|Shuttle> lol binki
20:21 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I started Retronet BBS
20:22 <+binki> :-p
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Sean helped with a lot of stuff, so I made him an admin
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I wanted to set up a minecraft server, but didn't think to use the phenom as a server, thus thought I didn't have a computer powerful enough
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> sean had a spare P4 he said he could set a minecraft server up on
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I said ok
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> so that became the Retronet minecraft server
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> WELL
20:22  * Compgeke|3G ran on a Pentium 4, and it lagged like hell
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> at this point he got power hungry
20:22 <~Tandy|Shuttle> wouldn't give me op or anything, and he called himself the 'evil admin'
20:22 < Darman213> whaaat
20:23 <~Tandy|Shuttle> he'd do stuff like fill your house with cotton you'd have to remove yourself, or egg it and fill it with chickens
20:23 <~Tandy|Shuttle> usually harmless stuf
20:23 <~Tandy|Shuttle> lately he kinda abused his admin powers
20:23 <~Tandy|Shuttle> so I started my OWN Retronet minecraft server on the Phenom
20:23 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Compgeke|3G and Mariorulez14 have been spending a lot of time there while I'm giving away Creative mode for a while while I build the map
20:23  * Compgeke|3G runs on a Core 2 Duo now...much better than ANY Pentium 4
20:24 < Compgeke|3G> I'm trying to get on now
20:24 < Compgeke|3G> but keep getting a fucking "Bad Login" message
20:24 <~Tandy|Shuttle> neko came in and started griefing saying that 'it's fun to mess with me' and 'you never set any rules saying no griefing'
20:24 <~Tandy|Shuttle> so I banned him from minecraft. He destroyed one of Mario's structures that took him 3 hours, he destroyed a row of my houses, and a whole railroad.
20:24 <~Tandy|Shuttle> THEN
20:24 <~Tandy|Shuttle> in here
20:24 <~Tandy|Shuttle> he gave an anti-spam bot an o-line
20:24 <~Tandy|Shuttle> set it to kick after 5 lines in 10 seconds
20:25 < Compgeke|3G> I can't see a thing on the server!
20:25 <~Tandy|Shuttle> mario and I were getting kicked left and right, and he refused to take it away. we weren't flooding or anything, just having a conversation.
20:25 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Compgeke|3G: ?
20:25  * Compgeke|3G needs a new laptop screen btw, it's REALLY dim
20:25 <~Tandy|Shuttle> And since neko got an oline on here he's been a bit of a dick as well.
20:25 < Compgeke|3G> there is too much light to see the server at night :/
20:25 <+binki> lol
20:25 <~Tandy|Shuttle> SO
20:26 <+binki> neko's always thought that since the power is there he might as well use it :-p
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Since I banned him from Minecraft and learned about his sabotaging tendencies, I deactivated his Retronet account to keep him from screwing with my forums.
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> He saw this and left.
20:26 < Darman213> D:
20:26 <+binki> :'(
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I will eventually give him back some of his privleges.
20:26 <+binki> his IRCd is dead
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I'm not completely heartless, and he's been my friend for a while.
20:26 < Compgeke|3G> I dunno...I'm strange, i run my server and give people random crap like diamond picks at random times because I'm bored
20:26 <+binki> should I take out of roundrobbin?
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> He needed a slap in the face, though.
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> binki: yeah, I think he literally pulled the plug on his ircd.
20:26 <+binki> you people need to be less political
20:26 < Darman213> Tandy|Shuttle, I think you're exaggerating a bit.
20:26 <+binki> lol
20:26 < Darman213> I barely even know Neko
20:26 <+binki> yeah
20:26 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Darman213: Howso? You weren't here for any of this.
20:27 < Darman213> Because you ALWAYS blow things up into a bigger proportion than they really are.
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> From what the logs say, you've never been on the new server, either (it's pretty epic)
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Yeah, uhm.
20:27  * Compgeke|3G wishes his old laptop had a dual core processor
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Ask Mario.
20:27 <+binki> he'll be out of round robbin in like half a day
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> He supports all of this
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> also
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Darman213
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> notice I gave you admin on the BBS.
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> finally :P
20:27 < Darman213> kthz
20:27 < Darman213> thx
20:27 < Darman213> *
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> lol
20:27 <+binki> lol
20:27 <~Tandy|Shuttle> but yeah, check out the new minecraft server
20:28 <~Tandy|Shuttle> Mario's an op on there
20:28  * Compgeke|3G has root power on his laptop here :D
20:28  * Compgeke|3G just needs to login as root
20:28 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I think Compgeke has Creative mode, too.
20:28 < Compgeke|3G> root kicks the shit out admin powers lol
20:28 < `> yeah
20:28 <~Tandy|Shuttle> mario made a library called 'Twilight Sparkle's Wet Dream'
20:28 < Darman213> you gave me the IP right?
20:28 < `> i even tried connecting on :6667
20:28 <~Tandy|Shuttle> and an underwater dome
20:28 < Darman213> ._.
20:28 < `> after looking at the DNS zones
20:28 <~Tandy|Shuttle> we have a whole city built at bedrock level, it's awesome :D
20:28 < `> and grabbing the IP itself
20:28 < `> i connected DIRECTLY
20:28 < `> and it gave me a ECONNREFUSED
20:29 < `> so
20:29 < `> yup, he DID kill it
20:29 <+binki> you guys aren't even girls, why is all of this emotional stuff happening!
20:29 <+binki> calm down

20:30 <~Tandy|Shuttle> I've put an insane amount of work into this, and so have a lot of other people in helping me with it

21:03 < `> now this chat is suddenly dead :(
21:03 < `> all because neko's all butthurt
21:05 <+binki> :-(
21:06 < `> i'd say link to me
21:06 < `> but that would also link ohnopub to rubbermallet
21:06 < `> unsure if miek/binki would like that
21:06 < `> ;)
21:07 <+binki> it'd be a bother to fight over services
21:07 < `> exactly
21:07 < `> rubb runs cervixes, so
21:09 <+binki> .
21:10 <+binki> I wouldn't really go on a net which ran a services package with that name...
21:10 < `> lol why not
21:10 < `> all i know is that he uses standard anope
21:11 < `> on the same serve as the unrealircd
21:11 < `> no additional modules at all
21:11 <+binki> `he' == ?
21:11 < `> mike
21:11 <+binki> ah
21:11 <+binki> sounds like our net
21:11 < `> http://rubbermallet.org/aboutme.html
21:11 <+binki> which means that merging the databases would work
21:11 <+binki> but would such a link last?
21:11 < `> i've been linked to him since day 1
21:11 <+binki> it's a bother to unlink and then have to get everyone to reregister
21:11 < `> and you'd be linked to ME

21:12 <+binki> lol

21:14 <+binki> let's randomly talk about linking for two years and then never link
21:14 <+binki> a plan?
21:14 < `> psh
21:14 < `> :P
21:15 <+binki> ;-)
21:25  * binki discovers that he doesn't have the discipline necessary to program
21:25 < `> lol
21:26 < `> what about slate_permutate?
21:27 <+binki> that's a product of my procrastination ;-)
21:28 <+binki> but you need to know that the origina idea for that was G's (Nathan Gelderloos) and that the initial web design/CSS was ethan's/normaldotcom's ;-)
21:28 <+binki> though, the whole autocomplete thing and crawling data from schools was completely me it wouldn't be known to like half of the people at Calvin College if it didn't have autocomplete because then noone would use it
21:29 < `> heh nice
21:29 < `> i know shit about programming
21:29 <+binki> I'll interpret shit as `nothing' in this case :-p
21:29 <+binki> you never know when people say that and mean they're sweet

22:33 <+binki> interesting
22:33 <+binki> so you can't just ship weed in USPS to a legal customer, they have to know how to verify your license, etc.?
22:33 < `> they require that i provide original doctor's recommendation, state ID, etc
22:33 < `> before they even show me the product.
22:34 <+binki> yeah
22:34 < `> yup, so yeah.

22:48 < Tandy|Phenom> my dad just realized that running a server off our home internet
22:49 < Compgeke> is a violation
22:49 < Tandy|Phenom> means that people accessing it hurts our download speed
22:49 < Compgeke> of the internet contract
22:49 < Tandy|Phenom> now he thinks every time that the internet has *ever* been slow it's because of my server
22:49 < Tandy|Phenom> ._.
22:49 < Compgeke> seriously, running a server here off the AT&T internet is a violation of the contract
22:49 < Compgeke> hasn't stopped me though

22:51 < Compgeke> there are*
22:51 <+binki> my one uncle has either sbcglobal or at&t internets and he has the same problem where the internet will just completely drop out for 2 minutes at a time, especially late evenings friday/sat IIRC
22:52 <+binki> I know because I lived there over the summer and it was a bother ;-)
22:52 <+binki> my parents' internet back in Dearborn is much more reliable
22:52 < `> so that means there's issues with your local DSLAM
22:52 < `> call AT&T and bitch.
22:52 < Compgeke> they just came out and fixed it...
22:52 < Compgeke> last week
22:52 < Compgeke> because it was out completely
22:52 <+binki> lol, mabye if I live there again and it becomes a bother
22:53 <+binki> odd
22:53 < Compgeke> the old modem is timing out on PPPoE connection, so there is a line problem, but lets not complain, we're moving in a month and a half anyways

13:20 < Tandy|Shuttle> two years now? :P
13:20 <+binki> hmm
13:21 <+binki> first commit is 2010-07
13:21 < Tandy|Shuttle> lol
13:21 <+binki> so 1.5 years, almost two
13:22 <+binki> lol, it'd be fun to check out the original version and see how different it is
13:22 <+binki> the oldest stuff in Hg, though, will look somewhat like the current one
13:22 < Tandy|Shuttle> heh
13:23 <+binki> have to go meet with a professor in 5 minutes and talk about how I'm making no progress on this senior projecty thing, though :-/
13:23 < Tandy|Shuttle> lol
13:24 <+binki> if slate_permutate was my senior project.........
13:24 <+binki> in fact, we had thought about that before
13:24 <+binki> _then_ I could say ``I'm not procrastinating, I'm just prioritizing my CS homework''
13:24 <+binki> but I'd have to actually do something more inventive than just add a bunch of new school support
13:27 < Tandy|Shuttle> slate permutate is a class scheduler, right?
13:29 <+binki> yesish
13:29  * binki poofs off to prof

18:26 < Mariorulez14> Started off with a 55-degree slant downwards, going into a hill with a drop of 75 degrees
18:27 < Tandy|Shuttle> where is this?
18:27 < Mariorulez14> After hoping you don't go airborne, you proceed down a 45-degree hill with bumps that have 60ish-degree drops
18:27 < Tandy|Shuttle> moguls?
18:27 < Mariorulez14> No, just like hills
18:27 < Tandy|Shuttle> oh

20:25 <+Darman213> We can has a restart on the counters?
20:25 <@Mariorulez14> And then he perfected it so that no man could best him in the ring of honor!
20:26 <@Mariorulez14> And then he used his fight money to herd two of every animal onto a boat, then beat the crap out of every single one
20:26 <@Mariorulez14> And that's why whenever there are two of any animal in one place it's called a ZOO

21:50 < neko|TwiSpark> this here laptop has intel graphics on it
21:50 < neko|TwiSpark> perfectly adequate for 720p MKVs and source engine games

21:53 < Compgeke|Laptop> back in 2007 this laptop had a 1280x800 screen, a gig of ram, 40 gig hard drive, DVD+\-RW Burner
21:53 < Compgeke|Laptop> and a 2 GHz Core 2 Duo
21:53 < neko|TwiSpark> and in 2012 it doesn't?
21:53 < Compgeke|Laptop> now it has a 1680x1050 screen, 4 gigs ram, 160 gig hard drive, same burner and still a 2 GHz Core 2 Duo, with the addition of Wireless B\G and 3G CDMA

21:54 < Compgeke|Laptop> I don't game on it

21:55 < neko|TwiSpark> my old ThinkPad T21 cost about $3699 back in 2000/2001
21:55 < Compgeke|Laptop> that looks like CRAP
21:55 < Compgeke|Laptop> this was probably around a grand back in the day
21:55 < Compgeke|Laptop> as it had the lowest you could buy for the laptop specs
21:56 < Compgeke|Laptop> I'm not even sure it shipped with the DVD-ROM

14:18 < neko|TwiSpark> at their house no less
14:18 < Darman213> Wow, Really?
14:18 < Darman213> that's awesome
14:19 < neko|TwiSpark> ya
14:19 < neko|TwiSpark> i wonder how long it took them to animate it

16:40 < Darman213> herro
16:41 < Compgeke> having a good 3 day weekend?
16:41 < Darman213> Meh
16:41 < Darman213> Not really
16:41 < Darman213> online school = If you're behind, THERE IS NO WEEKEND
16:41 < Compgeke> lol
16:41 < Compgeke> my school, if you fail, so does the rest of your grade
16:41 < Compgeke> almost EVERY 9th grader has a C or a D
16:41 < Compgeke> like 2 As
16:42 < Darman213> 0_o
16:42 < Darman213> that doesn't seem logical....
16:42 < Compgeke> everything is done in teams xD
16:42 < Darman213> but promotes teamwork in software teams I guess
16:42 < Darman213> ^
16:42 < Compgeke> so one person fails, everyone fails
16:42 < Darman213> xD
17:09 < Compgeke> aargh! someone on my server wants me to set my render distance to tiny

17:09 < Compgeke> I'm using the highest settings and far render btw
17:09 < Compgeke> I also went into the nVidia control panel and enabled Anti Aliasing for Java
17:10 < Compgeke> and I STILL get around 200 FPS
17:10 < Compgeke> limiting it to tiny render would be a waste
17:15 < Darman213> xD
17:16 < Darman213> that's funny
17:16 < Compgeke> I agree
17:16 < Darman213> What's your sever address again? I lost it :(

21:11 < Compgeke> who here thinks that relgion is a bunch of shit?
21:14 -!- CommanderHurricane changed the topic of #retrobox to: furries
21:15 < Compgeke> couldn't care less about this topic
21:15 -!- CommanderHurricane changed the topic of #retrobox to: keyboards
21:15 < Compgeke> IBM Model M's are the best keyboards ever
21:16 < Compgeke> anyone else have their favorite?
21:16 < CommanderHurricane> another model m user here
21:16 < Compgeke> I would use mine except the F1 spring is stuck down so it registers the F1 key as being always pressed
21:17 < Compgeke> I'll fix it eventually
21:17 < CommanderHurricane> i've had no issues with mine since i started using it on a regular basis
21:17 < Darman213> lol
21:17 < Compgeke> mine was dropped before I got it
21:17 < Darman213> >Religion
21:17 < Compgeke> so it has 2 broken key caps, it's missing a bunch and has the broken key
21:17 < Darman213> xD
21:17 < Compgeke> why else did I get mine for free?
21:17 < Darman213> bad idea to get started on that.
21:18 < Darman213> Personal preference of beliefs of morals and ethics
21:18 < Darman213> THAT I will debate.
21:18 < CommanderHurricane> i got my Model M for free as well
21:18 < CommanderHurricane> all it was missing was the F3 keycap
21:18 < Compgeke> yours complete?
21:18 < CommanderHurricane> then the F8 keycap went missing somewhere in my closet i think
21:18 < Compgeke> mine also came with 2 PS/2 cables and an AT cable for it
21:19 < Compgeke> mine has the detachable cables
21:19 < CommanderHurricane> mine is a later model with a non-removable PS/2 cable on it
21:19 < Compgeke> :(
21:19 < CommanderHurricane> not that big of an issue since i pretty much only use it on modern machines which only have PS/2 ports
21:19 < Compgeke> true
21:19 < Compgeke> I use mine with an AT to PS/2 adapter anyways
21:20 < Compgeke> easier than cable swapping

14:50 < `> WHY THE HELL ARE YOU USING WINDOWS
14:50 < `> that much i know.
14:50 < CommanderHurricane> BECAUSE I GOT BORED OF LINUX AND DEBIAN 6 WOULDN'T INSTALL ON THE OLD 1U RACKMOUNT SERVER I HAD
14:50 < Tandy|TERM2> OH GOD LOL
14:50 < Tandy|TERM2> Today, my dad sat me down for the sex talk. Almost before he could open his mouth, my mother popped her head into the room and said, "Be realistic, Dan. Who would want to sleep with that?" FML
14:50 < `> what a fucking bitch.
14:51 < Tandy|TERM2> yeah, kids that age have enough self-esteem issues...
14:51 < CommanderHurricane> for that matter, anything beyond Windows 2000 wouldn't install on the old 1U server
14:51 < `> i probably could.
14:51 < `> but i digress
14:52 < CommanderHurricane> `: be thankful i have enough sense *not* to use IIS
14:53 < `> i'd probably have tried the sid distro
14:53 < `> debian sid
14:53 < `> on that 1U
14:53 < `> since it has kernel 3.2.0
14:53 < `> aka more hardware support.
14:53 < `> i have a ISO here that uses sid in its installer
14:54 < `> never failed me, even if the squeeze install failed
14:56 < Tandy|TERM2> Today, my grandparents visited. My grandpa kept getting off the couch and walking around to "stretch his legs." He kept kicking out my computer's network cable and messing up my game, smirking each time he did it. When I complained, my mom told me to shut up and show some respect. FML
14:56 < Tandy|TERM2> ALL MY RAGE
14:58 < CommanderHurricane> `: i think the old 1U server had some hardware issues
14:59 < CommanderHurricane> every time i'd try to install Windows XP, Server 2003 or Debian 6 (text or GUI mode, didn't matter) it would always hard lock somewhere during setup

20:34 <~CommanderHurricane> why do you hang around here then? :P (kidding)
