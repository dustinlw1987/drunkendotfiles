11:56 < Sudos|X120e> -_-
11:56 < Sudos|X120e> don't start shit.
11:58 < Sudos|X120e> I'll say this much to end it. I don't need one, I'm at least losing weight, I choose to wear one when I see fit, and have IRL friends that are very supporting of my personal choices. it's more experimentation than it is anything else. I thought I'd share it with you guys in a non-confessional manner because I thought you could handle it.
11:58 < Sudos|X120e> I guess I was wrong.
11:59 < Sudos|X120e> you're nothing more than a bunch of crackbabies poking fun at anything that happens.
12:00 < tidux> no, we're just laughing at you because you're a vindictive little shit and it's nice to see the shoe on the other foot for once
12:00 < Sudos|X120e> I have channel seniority. I can be vindictive if I so choose to be.
12:01 < Sudos|X120e> same reason why no one kills mike.
12:01 < Sudos|X120e> CHANNEL SENIORITY.
12:01 < tidux> no one kills mike because it's his network
12:01 < Sudos|X120e> that too.
12:01 < tidux> and he has physical access to the main server
12:01 < Sudos|X120e> my channel though }:A
12:01 < neko2k> hmm
12:01 < neko2k> no
12:01 < neko2k> you have no usermodes here
12:02 -!- mode/#wtfpwnt [+qqq Sudos|X120e Sudos|i486 Sudos|PBG4] by Sudos|X120e
12:02 <~Sudos|X120e> I'm sorry, what?
12:02 < neko2k> ah. now it's your channel.
12:02 < neko2k> and mike's. and dustin's. and Sue's. and newform's.
12:02 <~Sudos|X120e> ......
12:02 <~Sudos|X120e> I told you how this channel came to be.
12:03 < NPE43> the great bang of dongs"?
12:03  * usoyasumi is back (gone 09:41:02)
12:03 -!- usoyasumi is now known as usotsuki
12:03 -!- mode/#wtfpwnt [+q tidux] by tidux
12:03 <~Sudos|X120e> no
12:03 <~Sudos|X120e> I joined this channel originally on DOSIRCd whne it was gaining a bit of steam
12:04 <~Sudos|X120e> usermode testing
12:04 <~Sudos|X120e> so then I had mike join too, tried some usermodes, needless to say dosircd crashed.
12:04 <~Sudos|X120e> dosircd was a pile of shit in 2008 and still is today.
12:05 <~Sudos|X120e> lolntcpdrv
12:06 <~Sudos|X120e> and for some reason became the spot to be.
12:06 <~Sudos|X120e> the original channel on the network used to be #chat or #lobby or something.
12:07 <~Sudos|X120e> three IRCd failures and a success in part later, add in UnrealIRCd into the mix, here we are.
12:08 < neko2k> >three ircd failures
12:08 < neko2k> dosircd, ircdlite
12:08 < neko2k> what was the third
12:08 <~Sudos|X120e> now 23 users strong.
12:08 <~Sudos|X120e> RockIRCd
12:09 < neko2k> rockircd was a failure?
12:09 <~Sudos|X120e> and a success.
12:09 < neko2k> ah
12:09 < neko2k> i guess the failure is the 15 user limit rockircd has
12:09 <~Sudos|X120e> because of the 15 user limit.
12:09 <~Sudos|X120e> yep
12:09 < neko2k> imma go get some lunch now
12:09 < neko2k> thank you for the history lesson
12:10 <~Sudos|X120e> same.
12:10 <~Sudos|X120e> leftovers, yay.
12:12 < NPE43> I had hotdogs
12:12 < NPE43> inb4 dongs
12:12 <~tidux> neko2k: keep in mind that he trots this out whenever he's being an asshole and there's a popular "ban the saudos" sentiment in the channel
12:14 < usotsuki> ^
12:15 <~Sudos|X120e> ^
12:15 <~Sudos|X120e> :3c
12:15 <~tidux> lol

12:19 <~tidux> oh god
12:19 <~tidux> I have these terrible, nasty smelly farts
12:19 <~Sudos|X120e> almost as bad as your face?
12:19 <~Sudos|X120e> :3c
12:19 <~Sudos|X120e> loljk
12:19 <~tidux> it's like the GOP candidates are holding a debate in my colon
12:20 <~Sudos|X120e> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
12:20 <~Sudos|X120e> BETTER
12:20 <~tidux> except no santorum
12:20 <~tidux> there is no santorum in my butthole
12:20 <~Sudos|X120e> then you are a very straight man.
12:20 <~tidux> I make santorum in women's buttholes
12:20 <~Sudos|X120e> >he gives anal to women
12:20 <~tidux> I slept with Rick's wife, and stuck it in both holes
12:21 <~tidux> I made two batches of Santorum that night if you know what I mean
12:21 <~tidux> Sudos|X120e: not yet, but I've always wondered
12:21 <~Sudos|X120e> well
12:21 <~tidux> deep subject
12:22 <~Sudos|X120e> yeah.
12:23 <~Sudos|PBG4> mmm, lunchu taimu
12:24 <~Sudos|X120e> GTFO I didn't tell you to talk
12:24 <~Sudos|X120e> fucking macs
12:24 <~Sudos|X120e> just because you have fucking macintalk doesn't make you the shit
12:25 <~Sudos|PBG4> Alright... BOB.
12:25 <~Sudos|PBG4> I'll soifk you up if you know what I mean.

13:16 < Sara> whats up?
13:17 < neko2k> TURBOCOFFEE
13:17  * Sara is getting her TNG on
13:18 < Sara> 24/7...nothing but tv shows
13:18 < Sara> :P
13:18 < Sara> and cheap 1.05 cumby's coffee
13:19 < neko2k> oh yeah i got a new router the other day
13:19 < neko2k> http://goput.it/drd.jpg
13:20 < Sara> no power supply?
13:20 < neko2k> no, there is a power supply
13:20 < neko2k> that's what those two red and black wires coming out of the router are for
13:21 < Sara> yuh, i saw that
13:21 < Sara> was wondering why you'd wire it up like that
13:21 < neko2k> because the power jack is broken
13:22 < Sara> also, is that a amiga next to it?
13:22 < neko2k> yep
13:22 < neko2k> http://goput.it/hm4.jpg
13:22 < neko2k> better shot of it
13:22 < Sara> nice.... i just traded one of those
13:23 < neko2k> mine is kinda useless though
13:23 < neko2k> first, it's an NTSC model
13:23 < neko2k> second, no workbench disk
13:25 < Sara> so, your on the PAL standard?
13:25 < neko2k> no, i'm in an NTSC region
13:25 < neko2k> i've just heard all the best Amiga games were released in PAL regions
13:28 < Sara> well, Ive got quite a few games left over from the amiga bundle i bought..most of them have the manuals etc stuff like maps 
13:29 < Sara> if your interested, let me know
13:29 < Sara> as far as the workbench disk...you cant image one?
13:30 < neko2k> no
13:30 < neko2k> i have no Catweasel card or other working Amiga to write disks out
13:30 <~DONGS> pshh
13:30 <~DONGS> do it like a man with a serial cable
13:30 < Sara> DONGS: sup
13:31 < neko2k> Sue: well that's what i was going to do
13:31 < neko2k> null modem cable + Amiga Explorer
13:31 <~DONGS> hold on a sec
13:31 <~DONGS> not amiga explorer
13:31 < neko2k> but no one i talked to ever sent me a workbench disk
13:32 <~DONGS> http://adfsender.stoeggl.com/
13:32 <~DONGS> you don't even have a workbench disk?
13:32 < Sara> i never realised that one can't be done from a pc with something like rawwrite
13:32 <~DONGS> what are you booting on, i could probably write you one
13:33 < neko2k> i've got an amiga 500 with kickstart rom 1.3 and 2.0
13:33 < neko2k> yay for kickstart switcher board
13:33 <~DONGS> it's got both on a rom switcher?
13:33 <~DONGS> hold on
13:34 <~DONGS> yeah that's entirely doable
13:34 <~DONGS> well, sorta
13:34 <~DONGS> to test it, i'd have to write to a floppy and boot a 1.3 workbench
13:35 <~DONGS> you can figure it out from there, right?
13:35  * Sara knows nothing about amiga
13:35 < neko2k> yeah, i should be able to
13:36 < neko2k> where did my null modem cable go 
13:36 < neko2k> i've been meaning to fix that thing for some time now
13:37 <~DONGS> i bought one from monoprice
13:37 <~DONGS> it was pretty cheap
13:37 < neko2k> i built mine
13:37 < usotsuki> Amigas use a nonstandard floppy format
13:38 < usotsuki> the Apple 3.5 DD floppy drives do too (both ][ and Mac)
13:40 < neko2k> ah, there's my null modem cable

13:51 < Sara> WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!
13:51  * Sara rocks out to some queen
13:51 < neko2k> no king_crimson is
13:51 < neko2k> and only he is the champion. of QuickBASIC that is
13:51 < usotsuki> but nowadays he mostly uses C, like me
13:52 <~Sudos|X120e> ._.
13:52 < usotsuki> though if you know QB, C's pretty easy to pick up
13:53 <~DONGS> >_>
13:53 <~DONGS> six-year-old problems: http://imgur.com/lJqZD
13:54 < Sara> aww
13:54 < Sara> so cute =.=
13:56 < Sara> someone told me at some point that cobol was the best for i/o control like motor relays, servo's and sensor data
13:57 < Sara> but that was..like 15 years ago
13:57 <~Sudos|X120e> if you have a machine that can parse the cobol fast enough...
13:57 <~Sudos|X120e> you can basically make that happen, yeah
13:58 <~tidux> ohai
13:58 < Sara> \o
13:58 < usotsuki> o/
13:58 <~tidux> what's this nonsense about using COBOL?
13:58 < usotsuki> LOL COBOL
13:59 < Sara> i was taught the best way to learn to program something like that was to write out a flowchart
13:59 < neko2k> coblawl
13:59 <~tidux> cornonthe - a kernel written in cobol
13:59 < usotsuki> both QuickBasic and Borland C have port i/o functions
13:59 < Sara> i was working on a simple pumping program
13:59 < usotsuki> COBOL = language designed by marketroids
13:59  * usotsuki lides
13:59 < usotsuki> maybe not but it really seems like it
14:00 <~tidux> usotsuki: so Java is the new COBOL?
14:00 < Sara> got lost when it came to figure out a math formula
14:00 < neko2k> alright, this nullmodem calbe doesn't seem to work
14:00 < neko2k> two wires broke off
14:00 <~tidux> neko2k: why do you need a null-modem cable?
14:00 < neko2k> and knowing myself, i probably soldered the wrong wire to the wrong pin
14:00 < neko2k> tidux: transferring disk images from PC to Amiga
14:00 <~tidux> ooooh
14:00 <~tidux> nice
14:00 <~tidux> what kind of Amiga?
14:00 < usotsuki> tidux, it's not so damn verbose as COBOL
14:00 < neko2k> tidux: Amiga 500
14:00 <~tidux> neko2k: nice
14:00 <~tidux> usotsuki: lol wut
14:00 <~tidux> Java is hugely verbose
14:01 <~tidux> it takes about half a kilobyte of source code just to do hello world properly in Java
14:01 < usotsuki> but you don't have to type commands in full sentences
14:01 < neko2k> that's the joy of framework-based languages, isn't it
14:01 < usotsuki> COBOL makes you do that
14:01 <~tidux> usotsuki: lolwut
14:01 < Sara> IE: start pump A, run for X minutes, check water level in sump, determine GPM, determine if pump A is adquately 
14:02 < Sara> ahem
14:02 < Sara> adquately handleing the task, if not, start pumpb
14:02 < Sara> bleh
14:02 < Sara> you get the idea
14:02 <~tidux> yep
14:04 < usotsuki> "ADD 5 TO X." vs. "x+=5;"
14:04 < usotsuki> lol
14:04 < Sara> sadly, my brain dosent do math well .__.
14:05  * usotsuki wishes they sold 4oz loaves of bread... less would go to waste
14:05 < usotsuki> for mii, I mean
14:05 <~tidux> usotsuki: just get big hamburger rolls
14:05 <~tidux> and use a knife
14:05 <~DONGS> i go through bread like butter
14:05 < usotsuki> wolo
14:05 < usotsuki> I've started to use muffins instead of rolls
14:05 < usotsuki> they last longer
14:06 < Sara> cornholio muffin :P
14:06 < usotsuki> is it me or muffins are more alkaline than regular breads?
14:06 < neko2k> yep. i thought so.
14:06 < neko2k> i soldered the wrong wires to the wrong pins.
14:06 < usotsuki> inb4 Nelson Muntz
14:06 < Sara> neko2k: just be lazy and buy one :P

14:50 < `|aao> gotta load up my scripts here for /sysinfo
14:50 <~tidux> wat
14:50 <~tidux> I thought Debian was i386
14:50 <~king_crimson> you can build 686 specific kernels
14:50 < `|aao> er
14:50 <~king_crimson> and they provide them pre-built too
14:50 <~tidux> ah
14:50 < `|aao> it just grabbed it from the repos
14:50 <~tidux> oh that's cool
14:50 <~tidux> it probably poked around /proc and grabbed the appropriate one
14:51 <~tidux> since Debian's awesome like that

15:01 <~tidux> dreamspark is like a drug dealer
15:01 <~tidux> the first one is free
15:02 <~king_crimson> lol wut
15:02 <~king_crimson> its ALL free
15:04 <~tidux> yeah, the dreamspark stuff is free
15:04 <~tidux> then you graduate
15:04 <~tidux> and all of a sudden the only way you ever learned to program costs $200
15:04 <~king_crimson> two words: express edition
15:05 <~king_crimson> and besides, most of the programming shit is NOT restricted to MS programs
15:05 <~tidux> I suppose it's a good thing they offer it free to students
15:05 <~tidux> they pretty much have to, since college students are cheap fuckers
15:05 <~king_crimson> yeah
15:05 <~tidux> even Apple's educational prices are less insane than usual
15:06 <~king_crimson> free Windows Server 2008 too
15:06 <~tidux> although actually, that was pretty much how they kept their user base alive during the 90s
15:06 <~king_crimson> >completely free legit OS
15:06 <~tidux> cheap macs for K12 education
15:06 <~tidux> then student discounts once they get to college
15:06 <~king_crimson> yesh
15:07 <~tidux> didn't work all that well until they got a new marketing team in the aughts
15:07 <~king_crimson> Windows Embedded Standard is free on there too

15:09 < neko2k> apparently my dreamspark registration expired a while back
15:09 <~king_crimson> its GREAT on netbooks
15:09 < neko2k> but
15:09 < neko2k> i had all the keys to the products they issued me stored in a text file on my computer }:A
15:09 <~tidux> dammit, why didn't they just put that on netbooks instead of that crippled Starter?

15:10 < neko2k> 'cause Embedded Standard is for, well, embedded devices
15:10 <~king_crimson> neko2k: how can you even get free stuff from dreamspark? you need to be a college student, no?
15:11 < neko2k> king_crimson: wrong
15:11 < neko2k> dreamspark is for high school students
15:11 < neko2k> unless they upped the school requirement in their recent update
